grepviewwidget.cpp/h is not needed anymore, since we use outputview.
It is copied just to serve as reference.

temporarily disabled during porting:
    proper quotation in dialog box -- see GrepViewPart:;searchActivated().
    At first line, print out actual command invokation as if it was run via shell.

    useProjectFileFlag() == always false
    slotKeepOutput()

    at Grepdialog:
    Kconfig
    icon
    tooltips
    KPushButton with GuiItem

    and many more..
