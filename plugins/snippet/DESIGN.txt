============================

*** work in progress ***

1. Basics
Snippets and repositoryies get displayed as tree.

Each snippet is stored on the disk in a single file. The filename is used as
name for the snippet. A snippet can not be imported into KDevelop directly, 
you rather have to import a repository.

A repository is a directory on the filesystem which can contain any amount of 
snippets and/or further sub-directories. By importing a directory, all
snippets and sub-directories get imported too. The top-level repository (the
directory selected by the user) can be given an alternate name for display in
the snippet tree. Each sub-repository automatically gets the name of the
directory it represents.

After importing, the repository and it's snippets and sup-repositories show
up in the snippet tree.

The user can import any amount of toplevel repositories. Currently only 
importing from the local filesystem is supported.


2. Editing
Snipets and repositories can be edited via the contextmenu of the 
snippet tree.

Changing a snippet's name will also rename the file from which the snippet has
been loaded. Same thing for repositories.


3. Contents of a snippet
A snippet can contain any kind of text. A snippet's text will inserted into the
currently active document uppon doubleclicking a snippet from the tree.
If the snippet's text conatins variables (e.g. $variablename$) that the user
is prompted to enter replacement values for the found variables.
