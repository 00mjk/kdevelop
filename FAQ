Q: Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62 

A:  There are 2 ways.

	1. : When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
	jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
	(Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
	from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
	then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
	be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
	of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

	It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have 
	the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
	updatedb 
	locate libjpeg
	locate jpeglib

	2: You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
	library (configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).

	

Q:  make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po' 
    cd .. && automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile 
    aclocal.m4: 2709: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete; use `AC_PROG_INSTALL' 
    make[2]: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1 
A:  Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just run 
    "aclocal" manually, then it will compile. 


Q:  What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.
A:  Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another giflib installed?


Q: How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?
A: Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline version

   for example: 
   old version AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
		kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
		kdevelop/templates/Makefile
   )
   new version: AC_OUTPUT(Makefile kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile kdevelop/templates/Makefile)
