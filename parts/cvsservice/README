This file contains a summary of any concern about the CvsPart plugin for Gideon
===============================================================================

(Feel free to add your comments here, but first fill this section so we can
know who said what and elaborate :-)
[M] == Mario Scalas [marios]

[M] This is an experimental attempt to integrate Cervisia HEAD's cvsservice into
    gideon (read FAQ). This part _does_ require cvsservice being installed on
    your system: I'm not an auto* wizard so you have to manually pass to the
    configure script the options:
    --with-extra-libs=$HOME/kde/lib --with-extra-includes=$HOME/kde/include
    (where $HOME/kde is where I install my own kde stuff so I don't mess with
    working kde installation)

    WARNING: Keep in mind that there are incoming changes in cvsservice architecture
    which could make this part quite subject to heavy modifications.

Current features:
* because this is a (buggy) direct conversion, as in parts/cvs.
* it is possbile to 'add as binary' files to repository

To Do list

(Ok, this is based on cvsservice so we have already the features: we need only to
integrate them ;-)

1. Adding the import feature for checking out modules from repositories: fetch
   a modules list and ask the user which one he wants to commit
2. login and logount from :ext: repositories

F.A.Q.

Q: Does cvspart support login with :pserver: or :ext: ?
A: You _must_ be logged in before using cvs operations because there is no
   support for login (this will change if requests come).
