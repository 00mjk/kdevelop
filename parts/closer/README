libkdevcloser
-------------

This is a very simple plugin, the only purpose of which is to display
a dialog showing the currenly open files and offering to close them.

Planned development:

# Decide if it is supposed to be a part of KDevelop at all, and if so,
if it is sane to offer it as a plugin or just put it in the main code.
