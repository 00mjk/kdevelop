			**** Subversion KPart ****


******* WARNING *************
This is really unstable/experimental for now !
Don't use it with important projects, you may lose files.

You need a recent version of Subversion (apparently >= 0.14.2) to
compile this kpart.
I develop it against recent Subversion snapshots.

For now it does not provide user interaction, but I hope to fix this 
soon.
It features : update,commit,add,remove and cleanup, other actions are
disabled for now.

Hope you'll enjoy it :)

Code stolen :) :
->there are some important parts of the code imported from the 'svn' command line source code
->the commitdlg has been copied from the cvs part
