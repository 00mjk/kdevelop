			**** Subversion KPart ****


	******* WARNING *************
*) This is really unstable/experimental for now !
Don't use it with important projects, you may lose files.

You need a recent version of Subversion (apparently >= 0.14.2) to
compile this kpart.
I develop it against recent Subversion snapshots.

*) Problems you can encounter :
->remote repositeries work (http:///) but not local ones (file:///) :
	=>that means you have a db3 around which overrides your libdb4, you need to remove libdb3-dev from
		your system and recompile the kpart so that it links first with db4 (ldd will still show you libdb3 but db4 has to be the first one !)
		Subversion client is also linked with db3 though it should not, Subversion authors are working on this

*) Code stolen :
->there are some important parts of the code imported from the 'svn' command line source code
->the commitdlg has been copied from the cvs part
