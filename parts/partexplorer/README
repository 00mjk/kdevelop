Let's sum up what it is this thing:

PartExplorer is a frontend to KTrader (http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/3.1-api/classref/kio/KTrader.html)
and uses its syntax, no more no less: so before saying "it really sucks", give a look at
http://developer.kde.org/documentation/library/kdeqt/tradersyntax.html.

It has helped figuring out several problems when querying KParts (ok, mostly mispelled names ;-), and I
hope that some other people will find it useful.
