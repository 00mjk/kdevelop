Let's sum up what it is this thing:

A quick and dirty hack for integrating CervisiaPart in KDevelop: it is nor complete nor without
the obvious "crashing feature" ;-P

WARNING: Change your Makefile.am:6 and replace "-L/home/mario/kde/lib/kde3" with the actual path where
"libcervisiapart.so" is installed ... there is real way to do so but ... this is just a dirty trick :-)

To make it comply with kdevelop GUI (file selector and ouput view being separated) I had to
produce Cervisia sources: this will probably break because cervisia will change in future :-(
The patch does:
 - remove private references to Cervisia own dialogs (that forced a d-pointer like approach
   to  make it work.
 - modify Makefile.am so that the cervisiapart.h header files is installed and available to
   host application
 - provide  two accessor methods updateView() and protocolView() for embedding in kdevelop
   bars (so we can embed them separately)

What the plug-in does:
 - creates the cervisia kpart and embed its widgets in gideon.
 - merge the two guis
 - intercept signal KDevCore::projectOpened() and use KParts::ReadOnlyPart::openURL(const KURL &)

Known issues:
 - GUI are "each on its own": we must find a way to force Cervisia to behave as we wish (for example,
   encapsulating it in a submenu or two)
 - once the project is opened, how to close it? ;-)
 - The patch will be soon obsoleted: once it is, the cervisia_plugin.{h,cpp} code must be
   re-hacked to deal only with KParts::ReadOnlyPart or re-sync the patch.


This code is only an experimentation dealing with cervisia: it will be nice to have all the
goodies cervisia provides but seems that XMLGUI wizardry is needed to merge the two guis in an
acceptable way. In addition I see no way to have common context menus for other plugins in
kdevelop :-/ (which is bad since we cannot have a file viewer for each VCS).

If you want to play with it feel free :-)) Just add some notes here if you have discovered something
interesting ;-)
