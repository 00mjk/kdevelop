The following illustrates the XML to configure the FileCreate part for a project. It simply consists of a list of filetypes that the user may wish to create for a particular project. At present, the "create" attribute is ignored.

The file create part looks for a file template called @ext (i.e. the value of the ext attribute) in the *project's* templates directory (see the PyQT appwizard template for an example).

For subtypes, it looks for a template called @ext-@ref, so in the example below the following files would need to be present in the project's templates directory:

py
ui
ui-dialog
ui-mainwin

Example XML:

  <kdevfilecreate>
    <filetypes>
      <type ext="py" name="Python" create="template"/>
      <type ext="ui" name="QT Designer" create="template">
        <subtype ref="dialog" name="Dialog"/>
	<subtype ref="mainwin" name="Main window"/>
      </type>
    </filetypes>
  </kdevfilecreate>

You can also use global template definitions supplied with the FileCreate part:
  <kdevfilecreate>
    <useglobaltypes>
      <type ext="ui" />
    </useglobaltypes>
    <filetypes>
      <type ext="py" name="Python" create="template"/>
    </filetypes>
  </kdevfilecreate>

If a type has subtypes, and no subtypes are specified, then all subtypes are assumed to be required (as in the example above). Otherwise, specific subtypes should be specified:

<useglobaltypes>
  <type ext="ui">
    <subtype ref="dialog"/>
  </type>
</useglobaltypes>

There's no GUI to configure this XML at present. Usually, it forms part of the base .kdevelop file created by the appwizard.
