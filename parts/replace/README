libkdevreplace
--------------

This plugin replaces a search pattern with a specified string, after letting the
user preview and choose which replacements should take place. The operation is
only carried out on files that are part of the current project.

Planned development:

# Make it possible to stop a find operation

# Better user feedback

# Some more code cleanups (Subclass the .ui generated file)

# Better commenting (doxygen style comments).




Current limitations:

# Search/Replace will work on all matches on a line.
 There is no (nor will there likely be) a way to limit matching to only some
 matches on the same line. In practice this is not a very big problem.
