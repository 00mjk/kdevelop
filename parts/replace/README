libkdevreplace
--------------

This plugin replaces a search pattern with a specified string, after letting the
user preview and choose which replacements should take place. The operation is
only carried out on files that are part of the current project.

Planned development:

# Colorization of the output view.
 It would be nice to match the colors of the grepview, and to specifically
 differentiate between the replacement string and the remaining text.

# GUI redraws during operation. (See Limitations.)

# Better tooltips. i18n wrappers.

# Look into using the QPoint info of the clicked signal, instead of the current
 stateChanged/blockClick() hack.

# Some more code cleanups and better commenting (doxygen style comments).



Current limitations:

# Doesn't update the GUI during search and replace operation.
 This should probably be fixed, but isn't really much of a problem, unless work
 is done on a large project and a slow machine.

# Search/Replace will work on all matches on a line.
 There is no (nor will there likely be) a way to limit matching to only some
 matches on the same line. In practice this is not a very big problem.
