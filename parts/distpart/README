Distpart.
=========

- User interface and global architecture designed initially by Ian Reinart Geiser <geiseri@yahoo.com>
- additional code by Yann Hodique <Yann.Hodique@lifl.fr>

This part aims to provide some help to the developpers for packaging
and publishing their projects by ftp protocol.

Only RPM package format is supported for now. More to come.
If you want to develop a new package support, please have a look at
specsupport.h and specsupport.cpp. Help is always welcome :-)

Development package, documentation package, application icon and local
options (in publishing tab) are currently ignored.

Another problem is that the creation of the source archive is just a
call to "dist" or "dist-bzip2" target of the Makefile. If those
targets don't exist, nothing is done to solve the problem (for
example when the project is QMake-based)
