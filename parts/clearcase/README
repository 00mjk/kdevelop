Integrates Clearcase configuration management system into KDevelop.
Based on Perforce implementation by Harald Fernengel <harry@kdevelop.org>

To use clearcase functions, you need to:
1. Create a view in which you will keep your project files
2. Start the view and open project as a view extended directory.
   IMPORTANT: If you have a view test_vu and your project is located
             under /vobs/source/project1 you should open the project
             from /view/test_vu/vobs/source/project1 rather than 
             inside the view from /vobs/source/project1. File open
             dialog does not show any files if you do otherwise. Who
             knows, maybe it will work for you. If so, let me know.
3. Clearcase functions appear in the popup menu for an open file just 
   like cvs or perforce.
4. Functions supported so far are: checkout, checkin, uncheckout, diff,
   mkelem, and rmname (not rmelem).
5. For mkelem or rmname, you need to make sure that current directory 
   is checked out or the operation will fail.
6. No support for snapshot views yet. I haven't worked with them.
7. To checkout a directory, select directory in file selector part and use
   popup-menu.

New enhancements:
1. Provided a dialog for checkout and checkin comments.
2. If selected file is not a clearcase file, "ClearCase" menu does not appear
    in the popup. A filename must start with /view or /vobs to qualify as a
    clearcase filename.
