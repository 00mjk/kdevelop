libkdevbookmarks
-------------

This plugin provides a navigation view for bookmarks and
persistance to editor bookmarks in such a way that it is
possible to have bookmarks in files that are not open and,
when implemented, that these bookmarks are saved with the
project.

Planned development:

# Real persistance - store the bookmarks to the .kdevelop file

# Grouping of bookmarks (?)

# Possibility of adding a "comment" to a bookmark (?)
