libkdevbookmarks
-------------

This plugin provides a navigation view for bookmarks and
persistance to editor bookmarks in such a way that it is
possible to have bookmarks in files that are not open and,
when implemented, that these bookmarks are saved with the
project.

Planned development:

# Real persistance - store the bookmarks to the .kdevelop file

# Tooltips to display full path

# Rightclick events for the navigation view to clear bookmarks (?)

# Tooltips to display source context for bookmark (?)
