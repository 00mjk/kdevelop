libkdevbookmarks
-------------

This plugin provides a navigation view for bookmarks and
persistance to editor bookmarks in such a way that it is
possible to have bookmarks in files that are not open and,
when implemented, that these bookmarks are saved with the
project.

Known bugs / limitations:

# Pre KDE-3.2 / KDE-3.1.3, using source reformatting, or
the ReplacePart will result in katepart messing up bookmarks
(and breakpoints). There is no current workaround.


Planned development:

# Grouping of bookmarks (?)

# Possibility of adding a "comment" to a bookmark (?)
