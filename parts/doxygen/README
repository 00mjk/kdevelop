To update to a newer doxygen version:
-------------------------------------

1. Copy over the files config.* from the src/ directory in the doxygen sources.

2. Copy over the file lang_cfg.h from the src/ directory in the doxygen sources.

3. Add the new i18n strings to messages.cpp

4. Update version.cpp

5. Add anything else you needed to do, to get it to compile, to this file.


Everything else we can customize for our look & feel.
