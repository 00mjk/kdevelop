Note: In order to update to a newer doxygen version, copy over the files
config.* from the addon/doxywizard directory in the doxygen sources. 

Note: The ConfigList class was missing an "init" implementation, so maybe
you have to add it again when importing newer doxygen sources.

Everything else we can customize for our look & feel.
