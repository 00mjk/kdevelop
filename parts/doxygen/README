What is this part?
------------------

This is the Doxygen part. It integrates Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) into
KDevelop. It allows you to call the Doxygen executable from a KDevelop menu.
It integrates a GUI into the "KDevelop Project Configuration dialog" to
configure Doxygen (it reads and writes Doxygen Conpatible configuration files).


Features:
---------

- Call Doxygen executable from a KDevelop menu.
- Configure Doxygen inside KDevelop.
- Create a configuration file with correct ProjectName, Author, Version and
  location of source files whenever a new project KDevelop is created.
- Automaticaly generate a Doxygen search database whenever you "Run Doxygen"
  and the "search engine" option in Doxygen configuration is activated.


Requirements:
-------------

You need to install the Doxygen binaries in your machine.
It is recomended that you also install dot (tool to generate graphical
dependencies).


Caveats and known bugs:
-----------------------
- It doesn't call the Config::check() function whenever you click "OK" in the
  configuration dialog. So the configuration is not checked and you don't
  get warning messages when you enter invalid settings.


To update to a newer doxygen version:
-------------------------------------

1. Copy over the config.h and config.cpp files from the addon/doxywizard/
   directory in the doxygen sources. You'll probably have to issue:
       $ ./configure --with-doxywizard && make
   to get the config.h and config.cpp files on this directory.
   You should also copy config.l if you'd like to do some debugging.

2. Copy over the file lang_cfg.h from the src/ directory in the doxygen sources.

3. Replace _ALL_ references to the deprecated QList class with the new QPtrList
   class in config.h

4. Add the new i18n strings to messages.cpp

5. Update version.cpp

6. Add anything else you needed to do, to get it to compile, to this file.


Everything else we can customize for our look & feel.
