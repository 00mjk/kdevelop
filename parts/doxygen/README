To update to a newer doxygen version:
-------------------------------------

1. Copy over the config.h and config.cpp files from the addon/doxywizard/
   directory in the doxygen sources. You'll probably have to issue:
       $ ./configure --with-doxywizard && make
   to get the config.h and config.cpp files on this directory.
   You should also copy config.l if you'd like to do some debugging.

2. Copy over the file lang_cfg.h from the src/ directory in the doxygen sources.

3. Replace _ALL_ references to the deprecated QList class with the new QPtrList
   class in config.h

4. Add the new i18n strings to messages.cpp

5. Update version.cpp

6. Add anything else you needed to do, to get it to compile, to this file.


Everything else we can customize for our look & feel.
