To update to a newer doxygen version:
-------------------------------------

1. Copy over the files config.* from the src directory in the doxygen sources. 

2. The ConfigList class in config.h was missing a public "init" implementation,
   so maybe you have to add it again when importing newer doxygen sources.
    void init() { m_value.clear(); }

4. The ConfigBool class in config.h was missing a public "setValueString"
   implementation, so maybe you have to add it again when importing newer
   doxygen sources:
    void setValueString(const QCString &v) { m_valueString = v; };

3. And add the new i18n strings to messages.cpp


Everything else we can customize for our look & feel.
