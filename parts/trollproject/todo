Priority (1 to 5) - 1 being top priority.

* Ability to remove subprojects (priority 1-2)
  Remove subproject should be a context-choice in the project overview
  treeview. (softly only - no deleting files and directories)

* Relative directories (priority 1)
  By default a qmake projects created with kdevelop must be distributable,
  therefore all directory-selections must be relative the subproject where
  it is used (user can override this ofcourse). So when a select-directory
  dialog is opened getRelativeDirectory() (#include pathutil.h)should be 
  called.  
  
  
* Ignore shell-expressions and qmake-functions (priority 2-3)
  FileBuffer should recognize and ignore shell-expressions and qmake-functions.
