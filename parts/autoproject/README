If you want to disable the default implemention for runing/starting the binary 
please add the following to your project file

<kdevautoproject>
  <run>
   <default_implementation>no</default_implementation>
  </run>
</kdevautoproject>

with this configuration KDevAutoproject doesn't insert the menuentry "execute program" 
and doesn't show the "Run Options" in the project configuration.

Now you can implement this features with your own special plugin.
For an example please look at the projects generated for GBA using the VisualBoy Advance Plugin. 
This plugin start the GBA binary. -- smeier@kdevelop.org
