Autoprojectpart is a projectmanager for Automake based projects. 

Loads and maintains Makefile.am files. The Autoprojectpart
supports creating subprojects, targets, services (.desktop) and applications (.desktop).
Automake projects can be configured on subprojects, targets (except DATA and HEADER targets).
It will regenerate the projects Makefile.am files dynamically as you add or 
reconfigure subprojects**. Unsupported automake features will be left unchanged
(hopefully), no major testing has been run yet (at least not by myself).

TODO (taken from TODO file):
-> automake part:
  - Should be able to DND files from other targets / file list / konq
    to add to targets.
  - Doesn't always get lib path relative to $top_buildir correct.
    (projectDirectory() != $(top_builddir) in general)
  - Probably some Makefile.am entries should not be written if they are
    empty (DEPENDENCIES, ... what else?)
  - Allow to remove everything you can add (subprojects, targets, etc...)
	-> Removing targets done**

**)
KNOWN BUGS:
-> Lower Automake Manager view does not update it's view when adding a subproject (and targets,
	etc to the new subproject)
-> When removing a target with "Remove files from disc" checked, check other target, e.g. "noinst_HEADER" if
	a file that has been deleted is listed there.
-> [FIXED] Remove Target seems to emit removedFilesFromProject wrong. No files with relative paths???
-> If removing the Active Target, update the .kdevelop file, too!

	
NOTE:
---
If you want to change  the default implemention for running/starting the binary 
please add the following to your project file

<kdevautoproject>
  <run>
   <disable_default>true</disable_default>
  </run>
</kdevautoproject>

with this configuration the "Automake Manager" doesn't insert the menuentry "execute program" 
and doesn't show the "Run Options" in the project configuration.

Now you can implement this features with your own special plugin.
For an example please look at the projects generated for GBA using the VisualBoy Advance Plugin. 
This plugin starts a GBA binary with an emulator. -- smeier@kdevelop.org
