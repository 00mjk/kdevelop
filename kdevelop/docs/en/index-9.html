<H3><A NAME="s9">9. Build Settings</A></H3>

<P>The Project Options dialog, accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
used for the Makefile.am's and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings ) and thereby set the
compilation preferences as well.. After changing the project options, you should invoke "make clean" or "rebuild all" to compile
your project with the new options. Please mind that debugging is only available if the project options are set to create debugging
information, the amount can be set with the debug level (0-3). If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included
in the linker flags, your program will not link correctly if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 General Options</A>
</H3>

<P>The first page of the Project Options dialog sets the general options for your project. These are project name and number, the
handbook sgml file which is used for generating a set of HTML files that are included in the project and specific information
about the author. The short description field is for additional information that you want to include like the program's purpose
and the like.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Compiler Options"></A> <A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Compiler Options</A>
</H3>

<P>The compiler options page sets the compiler flags towards your target, debugging and additional.
<P>
<H4>Target</H4>

<P>The target box contains three options that can be set:
<P>Target Machine: You have the choice to set the target machine option here by choosing between your machine (default) and i386v,
which is the option if you configured your compiler as a cross-compiler for an Intel 386-compatible machine running System V. This
option sets the -b flag to the compiler. Usually you would leave this to the default.
<P>only syntax-check: If checked, the -fsyntax-only flag is set. This means that the compiler will check your code only for
correctness in regards to the syntax, but doesn't check anything beyond that.
<P>Optimize: You can enable optimization for your build process by this option, meaning to set the -O flag. If not checked, the flag
is set to -O0, so no optimization will be used. If you enable optimization by checking this option, you can as well specify the
optimization level below from 1 to 3.
<P>For a release version of your application, enable optimization and set the level to 2.
<P>
<H4>Debugging</H4>

<P>Right of the Target box, you can see the Debugging-section. This means that you can set your compiler to include information for
debuggers within the final binary, so the programmer can follow the execution of the application with the debugger in direct
context to the sourcecode.
<P>Enable debugging therefore sets the -g flag; the debugging level specifies the amount of information to be included in the binary.
Availabel are level 1 to 3 to choose from. Mind that the binary execution will be slower by setting any debugging option and that
the binary size will increase by the debugging level.
<P>Generate extra information for gprof: sets the -pg flag, resulting that the compiler will include information for the gprof
program that displays caller graphs of your program's function.
<P>Store temporary intermediate files: sets the -save-temps flag. This will result in storing the usually temporary files produced by
the preprocessor and the assembler. A compilation of a sourcefile will therefore produce three output files: an *.o file which is
the final output of the compiler, an *.i file produced by the preprocessor and an *.s file as the output of the assembler.
<P>For a release of your project, disable any debugging.
<P>
<H4>Additional Options</H4>

<P>The text entry field on the bottom is intended for you to manually set any flags for the compiler by setting the CXXFLAGS
environment variable in the makefiles, so make sets the flags before the build process and reset them afterwards. For a complete
description of all available compiler flags you should see your compiler documentation; for gcc and egcs this can be done by
<B>man gcc</B>; <B>man g++</B> will show you information about the c++ script that is used to lead the compiler.
