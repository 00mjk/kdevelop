<P>Q : I have a question which is not adressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?
A:  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop to the KDevelop mailinglist which adress can be found on the KDevelop homepage.
All questions should go there and will be adressed there as well.  If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and all users
having the same problems, as well as helping to keep the FAQ up to date.

<P>Q: Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62
A:  There are 2 ways.
<P>1. : When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
(Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.
<P>It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
updatedb
locate libjpeg
locate jpeglib
<P>2: You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
library (configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).
<P>
<P>
<P>Q:  make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po'
cd .. &amp;&amp; automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile
aclocal.m4: 2709: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete; use `AC_PROG_INSTALL'
make[2]: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1
A:  Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just run
"aclocal" manually, then it will compile.
<P>
<P>Q:  What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.
A:  Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another giflib installed?
<P>
<P>Q: How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?
A: Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline version
<P>for example:
old version AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
kdevelop/templates/Makefile
)
new version: AC_OUTPUT(Makefile kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile kdevelop/templates/Makefile)
<P>
<P>
<P>Q:  I  get the following linker errors, what do I have to do to get KDevelop linked ?
/usr/lib/libqt.so:

<P>A: If you have the SuSE rpm´s of KDE-1.1, you must recompile the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall them.  .:-(
It's a bug in the SuSE rpm's.
<P>
<P>Q: I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).
A:  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.
<P>
<P>Q: If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?
A: Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new added files will be included as well.
<P>
<P>Q: If I removed a file, I get some weird linker messages. What is wrong with my project ?
A: If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler automatically on all headers),
your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project.
