<H3><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Creating a new class with the Classgenerator</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>New classes can be added to your project by selecting "New Class" from the project menu.  The following dialog lets you enter all
information needed to construct a new class.  First, you should enter the classname which will also preset the filenames for the
header and implementation files.  The Baseclass is the class the new class will inherit.  For Qt or KDE classes requiring QWidget
as a baseclass, you can also check the QWidget option.  Further the inheritance from the baseclass can be selected by public,
protected and private. The "Documentation" field offers a place for a short description for your class; this will be inserted into
the header file for documentation purposes and is placed there for KDoc to read. The affected Makefile.am will be updated with the
new files created and you can rebuild your project now containing your new class.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Adding new or existing files</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation file into several ones.
Then you need to create an new file which will get the part of the class implementation you want to move.  You can specify which
type the new file will be, including a template for pixmap files often needed to create new toolbar icons.   The new file will be
added to the project and all affected project files like Makefile.am etc will be updated.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 File Properties</A>
</H3>

<P>The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations.   For standard KDE location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Accessable Tools</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The tools-menu allows direct access to external tools.  Those are KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  If a tool is started, it will
be working in the "Tools" window and is closed automatically when you leave KDevelop. Another way of starting KDbg is that you
choose "Debug" from the "Build" menu or the debug icon from the toolbar, starting KDbg with the project binary.  If the binary
does not exist, you have to create it first with invoking make or rebuild all.
KIconedit can also be started by a click on the pixmap file in the LFV you want to edit, loading the pixmap automatically.
