<H3><A NAME="s6">6. KDE Dialogs</A></H3>

<P>A very useful thing of the KDE libraries is that they provide already constructed dialogs for various purposes that are common to a lot
of desktop applications. This has two reasons: a) the user feels comfortable using these dialogs if he knows them already from an
application and b) lessens the programmer's work a lot. In section 
<A HREF="kde_libref-5.html#Keyboard Accelerators">Keyboard Accelerators</A>, you
already got to know one of these dialogs that KDE provides to configure keybindings. For the other dialogs that are mostly part of the
<CODE>kdeui</CODE> library, the usage is mostly as simple as for the <CODE>KKeyDialog</CODE> and enhances applications within seconds of coding
efforts. You should always first look for an already existing solution for general value requests from the user before starting to
implement a new dialog from scratch. Further, you don't have to care about internationalization as these dialogs are part of the KDE
libraries and are already translated.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 KMsgBox</A>
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>KMsgBox</CODE> class provides a whole set of message boxes that match everyday life usage in applications. Using KMsgBox has a lot of
advantages: you can use one of the static methods to retrieve results on standard questions and you can still influence the behavior by
setting text, window text, symbol and button text.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>message(): providing a single message box with an OK button to inform the user</LI>
<LI>yesNo(): provides a yes/no question box.</LI>
<LI>yesNoCancel(): provides a yes/no/cancel box with three buttons. Used e.g. to quit an application with the question: Document has
been modified. Would you like to save changes ?. Then the yes-button would mean saving changes and exiting the application, no would
mean exit without saving and cancel would stop any exiting and just returns.</LI>
</UL>
<P>If this doesn't match your actual need, you could as well create a new KMsgBox instance that can have up to four buttons. This can be
used by applications that have multiple open files but don't want the user to ask if he would like to save changes for each file
separately; therefore these will need a button "Save All" or something. Then you could program the dialog towards your needs like the
static methods and will receive the correct result.
<P>As usual with dialogs, the return value is that what a programmer usually has to process by retrieving it into a variable and then
compare with <CODE>if()</CODE> for the actions to execute.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 KQuickHelp</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The <CODE>KQuickHelp</CODE> class provides a good way to add quick-help dialogs to widgets. The user can access the quick-help by a
context-menu entry "Quick-Help" and is therefore easy to use and gives enough information where a Help-button for the manuals would be
too much and a <CODE>QToolTip</CODE> would be too less. The reason I include <CODE>KQuickHelp</CODE> into the provided dialogs is that the
class-documentation itself contains example usage, but doesn't cover all formatting possibilities, therefore these are listed in detail
here.
<P>
<H4>Usage</H4>

<P>A quick-help window therefore can always be added to a widget by using the static method <CODE>add()</CODE>, also one help message can be used
for more than one widget. The example shows this by adding one message that applies to two widgets that are providing a funcitionality
that depends on each other:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;kquickhelp.h>
#include &lt;kapp.h>
#include "mydialog.h"

MyDialog::MyDialog(QWidget* parent, const char* name): QDialog(parent, name)
{

  file_lineedit= new QLineEdit(this, "file_lineedit");
  file_select_button= new QPushButton(this, "file_select_button");

  KQuickHelp::add(file_lineedit,
  KQuickHelp::add(file_select_button, i18n("Select the filename to process.\n"
                                           "You can use the lineedit or the\n"
                                           "button to select the filename.")));
}
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H4>Text Formatting</H4>

<P>
<P>The text inside your quick-help window can also be formatted to fit various needs, even hyperlinks. Using the KDE-FSSTD, you can also
access your online-documentation to provide a link for further information by just using your html filename. This is considered a nice
way to give the user the best information in some cases where the purpose of certain functions is too difficult to explain in a
quick-help window.
<P>The followindg list contains the valid tags for text formatting:

Hyperlinks                &lt;link linkname&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>Thereby, valid <CODE>linkname</CODE>s are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>http://yourlink</LI>
<LI>info://yourlink</LI>
<LI>ftp://yourlink</LI>
<LI>file://yourlink</LI>
<LI>mailto:your_address@your_domain</LI>
</UL>

These links will be opened using the <CODE>kfm</CODE> (KDE File Manager). All other linknames assume that you want to access your application's
online-help documentation and therefore use the <CODE>linkname</CODE> as the file you want to access and tries to open it with the KDEHelp
program.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 File Dialogs</A>
</H3>

<P>As the <CODE>kfile</CODE> library provides several dialogs for retrieving filenames as well as directories, those have to be separated towards
which class and method to use for which purpose.
<P>Generally, the <CODE>kfile</CODE> library offers:
<UL>
<LI>a <CODE>KFileDialog</CODE> class, which is a specialized <CODE>KFileBaseDialog</CODE> and provides the most needed static methods to retrieve
filenames.</LI>
<LI>the <CODE>KFileDialog</CODE> class itself, which can be subclassed but also be used for retrieving several filenames and directories.</LI>
<LI>the <CODE>KFilePreviewDialog</CODE> class, which offers file-dialogs that can display selected files by their contents if the developer
provides a preview module that is able to show a preview of the filecontents</LI>
</UL>
<P>For general file/directory services, the classes <CODE>KFileInfo</CODE> and <CODE>KDir</CODE> can be used.
<P>The following sections will discuss the usage and handling of the according file-dialogs in applications.
<P>
<H4>KFileDialog</H4>

<P>
<P>The <CODE>KFileDialog</CODE> class provides four static methods to ask the user for a filename. As the filedialog itself can handle the
creation of new folders, storing bookmarks etc, the user will be thankful if you use this dialog to ask for a filename to open and a
filename to save files to.
<P>The following examples show the usage for each purpose:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
// request a filename to open

QString open_filename;

open_filename=
QString getOpenFileName(const char *dir= 0, const char *filter= 0, QWidget *parent= 0, const char *name= 0)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>KFileBaseDialog</H4>

<P>
<P>
<H4>KFilePreviewDialog</H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 KColorDialog</A>
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>KColorDialog</CODE> provides an easy-to use interface to receive color values from the user. Color values are always requested, if
the application is a drawing or painting program to select the current brush as well as for e.g. KDevelop's dialogeditor to set color
values for widgets.
<P>The usage itself is often combined with a <CODE>KColorButton</CODE>, which is a specific <CODE>QPushButton</CODE> implemented in <CODE>kdeui</CODE> that
displays a color and calls the <CODE>KColorDialog</CODE> already when the user presses the button. Anyway, you can call the color dialog from
your menu bar or toolbar as well to retrieve a color value from the user.
<P>Using the colordialog is very easy inside applications. The class provides a static method which can be called to retrieve the color
value:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
#include &lt;kcolordlg.h&gt;


QColor myColor;

int result = KColorDialog::getColor( myColor );
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This creates an instance of QColor to store a color value and by calling the static method <CODE>getColor()</CODE> the color gets the selected
value. The returned integer value will probably be of no interest - its the result code of <CODE>QDialog</CODE> that specifies the dialog has
been exited via the OK or Cancel button.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 KFontDialog</A>
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>KFontDialog</CODE> will retrieve you a value for a font currently avaliable on the system. Therefore using the fontdialog will mostly
only make sense where you will need a font; the most recent usage is made by text editors but could be used to draw text inside a
widget as well as into a picture.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 KIconLoaderDialog</A>
</H3>

<P>For applications requiring an icon selection, KDE provides the <CODE>KIconLoaderDialog</CODE>. The main purpose is to select an icon on the
system to draw it on a button for example. Usage is made by the KDE window manager to select the icons for mounted/unmounted states of
device links. Then the values for the link are displayed on the according button to display the current selection; the filenames get
stored in the link file and can be drawn on the desktop as a symbol by loading the icons dependent on the state of the connected
device.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 KWizard</A>
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>KWizard</CODE> class already contains a predefined dialog to construct wizards that lead the user through an input process. Thereby,
the wizard dialog provides the necessary buttons and draws the according page numbers already, so that you only have to construct your
widgets you want to use as the single pages for the dialog and insert them in the order you want the user to proceed while calling the
wizard.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 KSpellDlg</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>(kspell) spell checking dialog for use with Ispell
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 DatePickerDialog</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>(kab) date selection dialog
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss6.10">6.10 Qt Dialogs</A>
