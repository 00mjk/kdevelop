<H3><A NAME="Creating new Applications with KAppWizard"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Creating new Applications with KAppWizard</A></H3>

<P>The KAppWizard, or also called the KDE Application Wizard, is intended to let you start working on new projects with KDevelop.
Therefore, all your projects are first created by the wizard; then you can start building them and extend the already provided source
skelleton. KAppWizard also allows to choose between several project types according to your project's goals:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Normal KDE Application: includes sourcecode for a comlete framestructure of a standard KDE application with support for the
Document-View-Controller model, a menubar, toolbar and statusbar as well as a set of standard documentation based on SGML, KDE-links
and application icons. This is the application type usually needed for a new KDE project.</LI>
<LI>Mini KDE Application: contains the same general structure as the Normal KDE Application type but with the difference that the
application's code only provides a widget as a window.</LI>
<LI>Normal Qt Application: works like the normal KDE application by it's code with the difference that the project is based on the Qt
library only and doesn't contain KDE support. This is intended for projects that have to be portable to Windows platforms or that don't
want to require KDE libraries by the end-user.</LI>
<LI>C++ Application: Is based on the C++ compiler only and runs in a console, therefore doesn't require X-Window.</LI>
<LI>Custom project: creates an empty project without any sourcecode. This is intended for already existing projects to port to
KDevelop or for projects where you want to start from scratch.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this chapter we'll see how the KAppWizard can be invoked and what has to be done to generate a KDE application project. This will
also be the initial step of our tutorial, where you will create your first version of <EM>KScribble</EM>. For all other project types the
steps are usually the same, just you may not have certain options available.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Invoking KAppWizard and Project Generation</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>Starting KAppWizard and the First Page</H4>

<P>To start with your first KDE application, open KDevelop. Then select "New" from the "Project"-menu. The KAppWizard starts, and you see
a tree on the first page, containing the project types. When a type is selected, you see a preview how it will look like after the
initial build process. Choose the KDE subtree, Normal type. Then press the "Next" button on the bottom of the first wizard page. This
will switch to the next page, where you have to set the general project options.
<P>
<H4>The Generate Settings Page</H4>

<P>For our first version of <EM>KScribble</EM>, enter <CODE>KScribble</CODE> as "Projectname". Then select the directory you want to have your project
build in; the default is your home directory. You can enter the path manually or you can as well press the button on the right to
select the directory by a dialog.
<P>Next, you have to enter the Versionnumber. For the first version, set this to <CODE>0.1</CODE>. It is usual to number new applications that are
in development for the first release lower than 1, and as the initial version will only contain the standard framework, we'll name this
the 0.1 version. During the following chapters, we'll increase this value along with the facilities that <EM>KScribble</EM> will get by our
implementation.
<P>Finally, add your name to the "Author" field and your email adress. We'll leave all other options untouched- they are needed for our
project.
<P>To give you some information about the options, you can press the right mouse button over the options, and you will get a quickhelp
window that describes the option's purpose.
<P>These are:
<UL>
<LI><B>generate sources and headers:</B>  generates the application sourcecode</LI>
<LI><B>GNU-Standard-Files:</B>  adds a copy of the GNU-General Public License to the project as well as some standard files for user
infromation when distributing the package.</LI>
<LI><B>User-Documentation:</B> the user handbook in SGML, already prepared for your project.</LI>
<LI><B>API-Documentation:</B> creates an initial HTML documentation set for the <B>A</B>pplication <B>P</B>rogramming <B>I</B>nterface.</LI>
<LI><B>lsm-File:</B> the Linux Software Map, used by distribution sites and contains short information about the project's purpose and
requirements.</LI>
<LI><B>.kdelnk-File: </B> a KDE link that will install your application in the "Applications" tree of the KDE-Panel.</LI>
<LI><B>Program-Icon: </B> an Icon that represents your project and can be used to create a link on the desktop.</LI>
<LI><B>Mini-Icon: </B> a Mini-version of the program icon that represents your application besides it's name in the KDE-Panel and is
shown in your application's dialogs and main-window in the left upper corner.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Now we'll switch to the next page by pressing the "Next" button again to set the template for the header files of your project.
<P>
<P>
<H4>The Header and Source Templates</H4>

<P>The header template page allows you to automatically include a preface for your header files, containing the filename, the construction
date, the year of the copyright, also your name and your email adress. You don't have to change those uppercase parts yourself, as
KAppWizard does this automatically and stores the template for this project, so it can be used later again for creating new files.
<P>The second part of the default header template contains a license information. By default, your project is set under the GNU General
Public License, which is also included in the package. This license is used for your souce code's protection against any person that
just copies your sources for his own purpose. The General Public License offers you this license for free and thereby protects your
rights as the author, and is common for distributing free software. To get more information about the license, you should read the
COPYING file in the base directory of your new project later.
<P>Anyway, you may want to choose another license or another header template you're already using for your projects. Therefore you can
either edit the given default template directly. To do this, you're given the template in an editing window. To clear the default page,
select "New", to use another template, select "Load...", which lets you choose the template file.
<P>When you're done, go to the next page by entering "Next". This is the template page for your source files and is generally the same as
the header template page. The only difference is that this template is used for your implementation files.
<P>
<H4>Creating the Project</H4>

<P>
<P>Now that you've set all options for <EM>KScribble</EM>, select "Next" and press the "Generate" button on the bottom of the wizard window.
If the button is not available, you haven't set all options correctly. To correct any errors, step back in the Wizard with "Back".
<P>Then you'll see what KAppWizard does- he copies all templates to your project directory and creates the new project. After KAppWizard
is finished, the "Cancel" button changes to an "Exit" button to leave the wizard.
<P>After this last step, you're finished with creating a new project. KDevelop then loads it and the treeviews let you browse through the
project's files and classes.
<P>In the next section, we'll discuss how to build and run your first version of <EM>KScribble</EM> and how the sourcecode is organized, so
you have an idea where we are and where we're going to extend the features of <EM>KScribble</EM> in the following chapters.
