<P>Quickhelp, Status messages, "What's this ?"
<P>For Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we integrated an extending statusbar message system, displaying statushelp for menubar entries and
process status for each selected function. The statusbar always shows you what KDevelop is doing. Furthermore, the statusbar shows
the mode of the insert / overwrite key as well as displaying line and comlumn position of the cursor in the editwindow. Dialog
fields offer quickhelp by right mouse button click so you don't have to worry about searching functions in the documentation.
Also, the "What's this ?" button on the far right of the toolbar offers help window for the main working view. Just push the
"What's this ?" button and click on the item you want to have a descriptive help for.
