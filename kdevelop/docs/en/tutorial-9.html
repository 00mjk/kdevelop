<H3><A NAME="s9">9. Extending the Documentation with SGML</A></H3>

<P>Due to the fact that projects often lack a complete set of user documentation, all KDevelop projects contain a pre-build handbook that 
can be easily adapted; therefore fulfilling another goal of KDE: providing enough online-help to support users that are not familiar 
with an application. This chapter therefore introduces you on how to extend the provided documentation template and what you have to do 
to make it available to the user. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss9.1">9.1 Why SGML ?</A>
</H3>

<P>SGML is a text formatting system that allows to create output in various formats; therefore technical documentation has to be written 
only once and then transfered to the desired output. The most used output is probably HTML to provide online help through web-browsers 
in a time where internet standards are available even on single-desktop systems. KDE makes use of HTML documentation by it's KDEHelp 
application where all KDE applications are listed and give access to their user manuals. To provide a unique look to KDE documentation, 
the KDE-Software Development Kit (SDK) contains a tool called <CODE>ksgml2html</CODE> which itself uses the sgmltools' sgml2html program to 
extend the HTML output with the KDE logo.
<P>But besides this, sgmltools allow output in plain text, GNU info, LyX, DVI, Postscript and RTF; therefore the SGML documentation can be 
easily used to provide a printed version of the online handbook.   
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 What the Documentation already contains </A>
</H3>

<P>When creating a KDevelop project, the subdirectory docs/en already contains the index.sgml documentation file and the already produced 
output HTML files. Those are already included into the project as well as their installation destination is preset to the KDE HTML 
directory. The documentation is already adapted to your project name, version number and the programmer's information. Further, the 
output covers the index.html file containing the table of contents (which is opened by KDE Help when the user requests help); an 
installation introduction and a copyright information. 
<P>Therefore, when extending the documentation, you only have to concentrate on the information you want to add. Mind that for KDE 
projects you have to run "Make Doc-Handbook" from the "Project" menu again after the project is created. The index.sgml file is again 
processed by <CODE>ksgml2html</CODE> and the logo is added. Then open the RFV and add the <CODE>logo.gif</CODE> file to the project and set the file 
properties correctly to install the logo file into the same location the HTML files will go.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3 Adding new Pages</A>
</H3>

<P>Adding another page to the documentation is very easy by adding another &lt;sect&gt;, followed by the name of the chapter to the 
index.sgml file at the location where your chapter will appear. For that, search the &lt;sect&gt; that is the chapter before and add 
your section after that into the sgml file. Whenever you want to rebuild your documentation output to control for errors, select "Make 
Doc-Handbook" from the "Project" menu which will invoke either sgml2html or ksgml2html depending on the project type. If errors occur, 
you are able to locate the error by clicking on the error message or selecting "next error" from the "View" menu.
<P>For each &lt;sect&gt; you added, another HTML output file will be generated; therefore all chapters after the inserted will change 
their chapters. This is important if you call your HTML documentation pages from within your application- mind that you have to whatch 
the page you call for help.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4 How to call Help in Dialogs </A>
</H3>

<P>Calling help in dialogs is often done by adding a Help-button; then you add a slot that is called when the button gets pressed. Within 
the slot implementation, call 
<P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
kapp->invokeHTMLHelp( QString aFilename, QString aTopic ); 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>where <CODE>aFilename</CODE> is the the filename to be called within your HTML documentation directory of the application; e.g index-3.html.
<CODE>aTopic</CODE> then is the topic that is to be called. The hash prefix is automatically added; just enter the chapter you want to have on 
this page, actually this would be a subsection's name.
