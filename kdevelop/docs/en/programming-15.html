<H3><A NAME="s15">15. KDE Developer Information</A></H3>

<P>This mini-HOWTO covers issues that are collected by David Sweet 
<A HREF="mailto:dsweet@chaos.umd.edu">&lt;dsweet@chaos.umd.edu></A>  in his <EM>The KDE Developer's mini-HOWTO (July 1, 1999)</EM> and was mailed at the KDE-Developer's
mailinglist. It contains information about CVS and package uploading to the KDE website which will be of use when you want to publish
your applications.
<P>The current version of the original document can be found at: 
<A HREF="http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/DevelMiniHOWTO.txt">http://www.chaos.umd.edu/~dsweet/KDE/DevelMiniHOWTO.txt</A>.
<P>The following is adapted for usage with the KDevelop IDE, therefore <B>NOT</B> representing the original text.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 Information and Source Code</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>
<H4>General Information</H4>

<P>The K Desktop Environment is an open source Unix desktop created by volunteers from around the world.  There are many ways to
contribute to the project.  You can write new code, improve old code, write documentation, translate to other languages, create
artwork, sounds, &amp; music, report bugs, and suggest new features.  If you would like to develop code, read on.  If you would like to
contribute in another way, please visit the KDE web site (
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>) for more
information.
<P>KDE uses the Qt toolkit which is developed by Troll Tech 
<A HREF="http://www.troll.no">http://www.troll.no</A>). The main
components of the desktop are a file manager (kfm), window manager (kwm), and panel (kpanel).  There are many more utilities and
applications which are included in the base distribution and available elsewhere.
<P>The primary programming language used for development is C++, although bindings are available for Python (pyKDE).
<P>The KDE code consists of libraries containing classes for e.g.:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>(libkdecore)</B> an application base
(KApplication), accessing configuration files (KConfig), launching
external processs (KProcess)</LI>
<LI><B>(libkdeui)</B> widgets (KEdit, KFontDialog,
KToolBar, etc.)</LI>
<LI><B>(libkfile)</B> utility classes like KFileDialog (a file
dialog)</LI>
<LI><B>(libkspell)</B> KSpell (a spellchecker).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Various desktop, configuration, and system administration utilities are also included in the distribution.  These are some of the
things KDE developers work on.  A more recent creation is KOffice, a productivity suite which includes a word processor, spreadsheet,
and presentation tool. The currently released version of KDE is 1.1.1.  KDE 1.2 will introduce theme support (which allows users to
dramatically change the appearance of their desktops), the KDevelop IDE and other programming tools for
KDE developers, and include bugfixes.  One should expect KDE 1.2 to be released in mid-July.  KDE 2.0, which is, perhaps, the main
focus of development right now, will include rewrites or major updates of kfm, khtmlw (an HTML widget), kpanel, kmail &amp; maybe kwm,
unicode support, and much more.
<P>KDE 2.0 requires mico, a free CORBA implementation.  CORBA is used to make the new kfm (dubbed Konquerer) easily extensible and to
create a document-centric user interface for KOffice.  The user can, for example, embed a chart created and edited with KSpread into a
document which has text created and edited by KWord.  Here's a bit from Simon Hausmann about KOM/OpenParts:
</I>]
OpenParts is based on KOM. It provides an easy way to graphically
embed other application's "widgets" , provides a clever way to manage
shared GUI elements, together with a CORBA/KOM interface/implementation of
these, and it implements the basic support for the document view model,
extensively used by KOffice.

See kdenonbeta/corbadoc/komop.html in CVS for more.

<H4>Mailing lists</H4>

<P>
<P>The list kde-devel is for KDE developers in general.  The koffice mailing list is for developers interested in koffice, and kfm-devel
is for kfm (the file manager) developers.
<P>Send a message to either kde-devel-request or koffice-request with the messag "subscribe myid@myserver" (where myid@myserver stands for
your email address).  Go to the KDE mail page a click on "Mailing Lists" for more information about other KDE mailing lists and the
mailing list archive.
<P>Toll Tech provides a list for users of the Qt 2.0 snapshots (discussed below).  You may subscribe to this by sending an email to
<A HREF="mailto:snapshot-users-request@troll.no">snapshot-users-request@troll.no</A> with the _message_ "subscribe".
<P>
<P>As a KDE developer you may want or need a kde email address, like joedeveloper@kde.org.  To obtain one, send an email to Martin Konold
at 
<A HREF="konold@kde.org">konold@kde.org</A>.
<P>To gain access to the KDE CVS respository (discussed below), send an email with an encrypted password to Stephan Kulow
<A HREF="mailto:coolo@kde.org">&lt;coolo@kde.org></A>.
<P>To get your encrpyted password, type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
perl -e print\ crypt\('passwd','sa'\)\.\"\\n\"
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>where passwd is your choice of password and sa is two random characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./]. The output is the encrypted
passwd.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 KDE CVS</A>
</H3>

<P>The KDE CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is the source code repository for the KDE project.  You can access it via
<P>(i) WWW: http://www., (ii) cvs utility,  (iii) cvsup utility, or (iv) snapshots.
<P>You will need CVS access only for (ii); (i), (iii), and (iv) are read-only methods and available to the public.
<P>The web page for method (i) explains its usage.  I haven't an explanation for method (iii), cvsup, yet.  Please see
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/cvsup.html">http://www.kde.org/cvsup.html</A> [-- Perhaps someone who uses it will contribute a
short explanation of usage and information on obtaining it. --] The snapshots, (iv), are .tar.bz2 files which contain a section of KDE
code (called "modules"; ex, kdelibs, kdeutils) as it looked on some specified day (specified in the filename: ex,
kdelibs990517.tar.bz2).  The snapshots are posted daily in 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/CVS/snapshots">ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/CVS/snapshots</A>. [ (ii) is described below. ]
<P>The repository (or, just "CVS") stores all of the changes made to the source code by all of the contributors so that changes may
be undone.  Each time a user makes a change (s)he includes a comment so that the devlopment of code can be more easily followed.  These
comments are sent to the kde-cvs mailing list.  The CVS splits into _branches_ which may contain different versions of the KDE project.
For example, the two branches being developed now are KDE_1_1_BRANCH and HEAD.  They both are derived from the same code (i.e., if you
"undid" enough of the changes made to either branch you'd reveal identical source code) but used for different purposes.  Here are some
branches and descriptions for your reference:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>KDE_1_1_1_RELEASE - code that was considered stable, released, and distributed as KDE 1.1.1</LI>
<LI>KDE_1_1_BRANCH - derived from KDE_1_1_1_RELEASE; being developed for KDE 1.1.2; will include themes and bugfixed; based on Qt
1.42.   </LI>
<LI>HEAD - code which will become KDE 2.0.  It is based on Qt 2.0, requires mico, has a new kwm, kpanel, etc.  LOTS of changes.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>The cvs utility is probably on your system.  To learn to use it I would recommend reading the man page!  Below is an explanation of
some common functions.
<P>Let's assume below that your username is joedeveloper.  As written below you should enter all of these commands from some base
directory. (KDE/CVS is not a bad choice!)
<P>Set the environment variable CVSROOT to :pserver:joedeveloper@cvs.kde.org:/home/kde.
<P>Checking out a module, ex. kdelibs from HEAD
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cvs -z6 checkout -r HEAD kdelibs
  cvs -z6 checkout kdelibs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The -z6 option tells the server to compress the code at "level 6" before sending it to you.  This may speed things up for you.
The -r options tells cvs which branch you want to checkout from. The default is the HEAD branch.
<P>Checking out a module, ex. kdelibs, from KDE_1_1_BRANCH
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cvs -z6 checkout -r KDE_1_1_BRANCH kdelibs
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note: you could use co as an abbreviation for checkout.
<P>Checking out an application from within a module (ex kjots, which is in the kdeutils module) from the HEAD branch
<P>
<OL>
<LI>cvs -z6 co -l kdeutils</LI>
<LI>cvs -z6 co -l admin</LI>
<LI>cvs -z6 co -l kdeutils/kjots</LI>
<LI>cd kdeutils; ln -s ../admin</LI>
</OL>
<P>The -l in line (1) tells cvs not to recurse the subdirectories of kdeutils.  This means will get the configure script and its
companions (discussed below), but none of the application source code.
<P>Line (2) gets the admin directory which contains support files for autoconf and friends.  (This directory is retrieved automatically
when checking out an entire module.)
<P>Line (3) gets the kjots source.
<P>Line (4) makes a link to the admin directory.  (This is better than copying or moving the directory here.  If you leave admin where cvs
put if then you can easily update the admin directory with cvs.  You could also make links to admin from any other modules you check
out this way and thus have only one, up-to-date copy of admin.)
<P>Updating source code you've previously checked out (ex. kdeutils/kjots)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cvs -z6 update kdeutils/kjots
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The source code for kjots on your hard drive will be updated to match the code in the CVS.  You don't need to specify the branch here.
The correct branch is stored in kdeutils/kjots/CVS/Tag.
<P>Commiting changes (putting them into CVS) (ex. kdeutils/kjots)
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cvs -z6 commit kdeutils/jots
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You'll be prompted to edit a comment.  Enter a short one which desribes the changes you're making with this commmit.  (You can use
your editor of choice by setting the EDITOR or CVSEDITOR environment variable.)
<P>Adding a file (ex. kdeutils/kmyapp/greatnewcode.cpp) [create the file first!]
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cd kdeutils/kmyapp
  cvs add greatnewcode.cpp
  cvs commit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Deleting a file (ex. kdeutils/kmyapp/badoldcode.cpp)
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cd kdeutils/kmyapp
  rm badoldcode.cpp
  cvs remove badoldcode.cpp
  cvs commit
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Adding a directory (a module, like a new app) (ex. kdeutils/kmyapp, with the source file kmysource.cpp)
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cd kdeutils
  mkdir kmyapp
  (create the kmyapp/kmysource.cpp file)
  cvs add kmyapp
  cvs add kmyapp/kmysource.cpp
  cvs commit    (actually puts the directory and file in the CVS)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note: You need to have files in a directory to commit it.
<P>Removing a directory (a module, like a new app) (ex. kdeutils/kmyapp)
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
  cd kdeutils/kmyapp
  (delete all files, as described above in "Deleting a file")
  cd ..
  cvs -P update  (will remove the local kmyapp automatically)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 Compiling and Safe Development Practices (with configure)</A>
</H3>

<P>Before you start downloading and compiling the latest sources you
should be aware that there's a good chance they won't work!  They are
in a state of constant development so they could very well have bugs.
<P>Knowing this, you should find a way to compile and run new KDE stuff
without interfering with your existing stable KDE setup.  Here's one
way, using the HEAD branch as an example.  We, again, assume your
login is joedeveloper.  We also assume that your home directory is in
/home/joedeveloper.  (This would be the case for Red Hat systems.)
<P>
<H4>Organizing</H4>

<P>Make a directory called KDE in the home directory of your *user*
account.  You should not be doing any of this as root!  Make another
called KDE/CVS-HEAD.  cd into that directory and get the KDE sources
from the HEAD branch that you want.  The (minumum) modules needed to
use an application are: kdesupport, kdelibs.  You should compile and
install them in that order (see below for compiling).  Others you
might want are: kdebase, kdeutils, kdegraphics, etc. Now, make a
directory called KDE/kde-HEAD.  This is where you'll store the
compiled code from the HEAD branch -- as well as Qt 2.0!
<P>
<H4>Compiling Qt 2.0</H4>

<P>Let's get Qt 2.0.  (Get the official release version.  It's
available now).  Put the sources in KDE/kde-HEAD. To compile the
code, <CODE>cd</CODE> to KDE/kde-HEAD and
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        gzip -d qt-2.00.tar.gz
        tar -xvf qt-2.00.tar
        ln -s qt-2.00 qt
        cd qt
        setenv QTDIR $PWD     (if you use csh/tcsh, change this for bash)
        cd configs
        mv linux-g++-shared linux-g++-shared.orig
        sed s/-fno-rtti// linux-g++-shared.orig > linux-g++-shared  (Note, this step may not be needed with the release version of Qt 2.0, but it shouldn't hurt.)
        ./configure
        make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You should compare the files configs/linux-g++-shared and
configs/linux-g++-shared.orig if you don't know what the sed is doing.
Then look up the -fno-rtti option of <CODE>egcs</CODE> if you'd like to learn more.
<P>
<H4>Compiling KDE (HEAD)</H4>

<P>
<P>Now, for the KDE code.  <CODE>cd</CODE> to KDE/CVS-HEAD/kdesupport.  Type
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        make -f Makefile.cvs
        ./configure --prefix=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD --with-qt-dir=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD/qt
                        --with-qt-libs=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD/qt/lib   
        make

If all goes well, then
        
        make install

If not, try to fix things, then type
        
        make install

Repeat this process for the other modules.  You should alter the ./configure line to read

        ./configure --prefix=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD --with-qt-dir=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD/qt
                        --with-qt-libs=/home/joedeveloper/KDE/kde-HEAD/qt/lib --enable-new-stuff --enable-tutorials

when you compile the code in the kdelibs module.

<P>
<H4>Compiling tips</H4>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>  We turned off the "-fno-rtti" option when compiling Qt 2.0 because it
prevents KDE from linking.</LI>
<LI> I usually put that long configure command into a file called <CODE>conf</CODE> and leave it in my CVS-HEAD directory.  Then I can do a <CODE>../conf</CODE> from any module and get a good configure.</LI>
<LI> It seems that you need to compile and install qimageio (part of Qt)
separately if you want to get koffice to compile.  Just <CODE>cd</CODE> to <CODE>/$QTDIR/extensions/imageio/src</CODE> and type <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>
<LI> When you compile mico, be sure to configure it with <CODE>./configure --disable-mini-stl</CODE> (and any other options you want).  And be sure you have version 2.2.7!</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 Packaging and Submitting Code to KDE</A>
</H3>

<H4>Packaging</H4>

<P>'Packing' means putting your (in this case source) code into some
format that is
<UL>
<LI> easy for others to configure and install, and</LI>
<LI> easy to transfer,</LI>
<LI> can be indexed so that it is easy to find.</LI>
</UL>
<P>These three concepts are expanded upon in the next three subsections.
<P>
<H4>GNU Configure</H4>

<P>The standard KDE application (or other code) source code package
includes the GNU <CODE>configure</CODE> script which determines some
information about the user's system and provides it to your
source code as <CODE>#define</CODE> statements in a header file called
<CODE>config.h</CODE>.
<P>To get started with this, get the kdesdk from CVS using a
method described above.  Then prepare kexample, an example
package, for your application
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   cd kdesdk
   cd kexample
   make -f Makefile.cvs
   cd ..; cp -r kexample ~/KDE/kmyapp-0.0.1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(That last directory is just an example.  Replace kmyapp with your
application's (or widget's) name, and replace 0.0.1 with its version
number.)
<P>Now, we'll put your source code into the example package.  Let's
say your source code was in the directory &nbsp;/KDE/KMyApp:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   cd ~/KDE/kmyapp-0.0.1
   mkdir kmyapp
   cp ~/KDE/KMyApp/*.cpp kmyapp
   cp ~/KDE/KMyApp/*.h kmyapp
   (There may be other files to copy, but leave your old Makefile behind!)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Now, edit kmyapp-0.0.1/Makefile.am and change the line
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   SUBDIRS = kexample
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

to
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   SUBDIRS = kmyapp
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<EM>Note</EM>:  kmyapp here refers to the subdirectory by that name.  You
could include more subdirectories to be compiled.  For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   SUBDIRS = kmyapp kmysupportclass
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Also edit the last line of configure.in to read
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
          kmyapp/Makefile \
          po/Makefile)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>po</CODE> directory contains translations of strings that you
used in your code (this is about i18n(), which is not covered in this
miniHOWTO).  We'll get to that it a minute.
<P>Now we want to set up the Makefile for the kmyapp subdirectory.  Edit
<CODE>kmyapp/Makefile.am</CODE> according to the instructions given in the
comments.  They should be clear enough.
<P>Now <CODE>cd ~/KDE/kmyapp</CODE> and type
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   ./configure
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This should create:
<UL>
<LI> Makefile</LI>
<LI> kmyapp/Makfile</LI>
<LI> config.h</LI>
</UL>

You can now include config.h in your source code with <CODE>#include "../config.h"</CODE> and have your code compile differently on different systems based
on the <CODE>#define</CODE>s.  Eh?  Well, different systems have slightly
differnent ideas about implementing standards and such, and your
code my need take this into account to be portable, i.e. to work on
various Unices.  Take a look inside <CODE>config.h</CODE> for descriptions
of the <CODE>#define</CODE>s.
<P><B>Shared Libraries!</B>  If you are packaging a widget or other class
you should be compiling a shared library.  Luckily, this is easy to do
within the kexample packge.  You only need to change the Makefile.am
that resides in your code's sudirectory.  Unluckily, now example
for a shared-library Makefile.am is included.  So, I've included one
in the next section.
<EM>Note</EM>:  If you distribute a widget, you should also
disrtribute a small program which tests the widget.  Put that
program in the same package in another subdirectory and have it
compile along with the widget.
<P>Next, make a compressed archive.  You can do it this way
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
   cd ~/KDE
   tar -cvf kmyapp-0.1.1.tgz kmyapp-0.1.1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

or however you like.  Just be sure that the archive expands to
<EM>one</EM> directory containing all of the files.  This is neater and
easier for the user to deal with.

directory with all of your stuff in it. Within KDevelop, choose "Project"-"Create Distribution"-"tar.gz" which automatically creates
the tar.gz file.

<P>If you are hacking at CVS, you should follow the commit procedure
outlined above.  If you want to submit changes to code
that you are not maintaining, you should first check with the
maintainer of the application.  You can usually find his/her email address
in the directory containing the source.  Also check the program's "About" box
if it has one.  If no maintainer is specifically listed, you should
contact the author.
<P>If you are developing outside of CVS, you can submit your code
(widgets, applications, etc.) via FTP to
<A HREF="ftp://upload.kde.org/Incoming">ftp://upload.kde.org/Incoming</A><P>When you do this be sure to include an <CODE>.lsm</CODE> (Linux Software Map) file.
This way your code can be automatically placed in the appropriate spot
on ftp.kde.org and its mirrors and an announcement can be
automatically sent to the kde-announce mailing list.
<P><EM>Note</EM>: The <CODE>.lsm</CODE> file should be uploaded separately from the
source code (as a plain ASCII file).  The source code should be
packaged as a .tar.gz (or .tgz) or .tar.bz2.  This archive should
expand to a single directory with all of your stuff in it.
