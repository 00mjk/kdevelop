<P>As the K Desktop Environment offers an easy way for application designers to offer their products with an intuitive way of user
interaction, it provides all means to solve common tasks by a set of library classes that extend the facilities of the Qt toolkit.
This also allows a unique look to applications as well as interaction with other programs and the window manager. This handbook
therefore intends to provide an introduction into the usage of the KDE libraries that ship with the KDE to enable developers to find
easy solutions for common programming issues and explains why certain techniques and classes should be used when creating applications
that are targeting the K Desktop Environment.
<P>Basically, KDE offers a set of standards that allow a unique look and usage of applications that should be watched when designing
programs. A lot of tasks are done automatically, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Session Management</LI>
<LI>Standard keyboard accelerator configuration</LI>
<LI>Font, Color and Style changing</LI>
<LI>Theme support (KDE 1.1.2 and higher)</LI>
<LI>Internationalization</LI>
</UL>
<P>Therefore, theses issues only have to be mentioned in their functionality for complete information. Application developers only have to
care about what their program is intended to do and where KDE can help. There, KDE offers user interfaces that extend the Qt toolkit
where necessary. If both libraries offer similar solutions, KDE developers should (in most cases) use the methods provided by the KDE
libraries.
<P>Here, KDE offers a set of widgets that can be used for creating application specific dialogs and views. Examples are
<UL>
<LI>KSeparator, offering a common separator line</LI>
<LI>KColorButton, offering a push button displaying a color</LI>
</UL>
<P>Normally, applications ask the user to select various values. Here, the libraries provide easy means to get these values by complex
widgets that are ready to use and are already known to the user by the KDE desktop, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>File dialogs,</LI>
<LI>Color dialogs,</LI>
<LI>Font dialogs,</LI>
<LI>Keyboard configuration dialogs</LI>
</UL>
<P>These should be used wherever a user setting is required as it simplifies the programmer's work, extends the application's facilities
dramatically and provide a common look.
<P>The Qt library is addressed in this handbook as far as it offers solutions not provided by KDE.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 About this Handbook</A>
</H3>

<P>This handbook has been written in order to give developers a guideline to the usage of the KDE libraries in general in conjunction with
the Qt library on X11 desktop systems. It cannot replace any programming knowledge that is needed for C++ programming and covers the Qt
classes where necessary. You should in any case look at the page "Structure Overview" of the Qt online reference which contains a
general guidance to the Qt library by class usage in general. This handbook tries to follow this structure to complete your knowledge
about where KDE classes are appropriate and explains the technique of KDE application development by describing class usage on topics.
