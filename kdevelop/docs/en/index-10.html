<H3><A NAME="ss10.1">10.1 The Classviewer</A>
</H3>

<P>The KDevelop Classviewer is one of the most useful and important tools that the IDE provides a developer for managing his project
sources. When a project is loaded, a classparser reads all project sources for functions, classes etc., then displays the results in
the CV treeview. This chapter shows you how to use the Classviewer and the provided functionality and how it can improve your work.
<P>
<H4>Available Objects</H4>

<P>By available objects, we describe a term that means that C++ code can be seen as a collection of objects- classes, their members,
global functions and the like. The classtree displays these objects logically and orders them by character, so they are easy to locate
in the tree as well by their according icon. Therefore the classtree contains a "Classes" and a "Globals" folder. Thereby the "Classes"
folder generally contains the project's classes; if your project contains subfolders to manage your sourcefiles, these are also
displayed by their original folder name and contain all classes that are stored in the files located in the subfolder.
<P>Further, when popping up a class, the classtree displays the class contents by separating methods and attributes. As these can have
attributes as well like public, private and protected, these are displayed by modified icons as well. You see that a class displayed in
the classbrowser contains all the objects that are present in the class declaration.
<P>Now, classes are a very common thing when programming in C++ and will contain most of the code. But applications also contain objects
that have a "Global" appearance to the program. These would be structs, functions etc. Especially the <CODE>main()</CODE> function appears in
every application and you need to modify it in one or the other way sometimes. To access these objects, the Classviewer provides the
"Globals" folder, containing subfolders for the following object types:
<UL>
<LI>Structs</LI>
<LI>Functions</LI>
<LI>Variables</LI>
</UL>
<P>As the icons displaying these items are similar to those used in the class-viewer, their meaning is easy to guess and to remember by
the programmer.
<P>Finally, it can be stated that the classviewer displays your project graphically by their objects related to their appearance in the
code. In the following section you will learn how to use the classviewer and it's tools in conjunction with your code.
<P>
<H4>Browsing Object Declarations and Implementations</H4>

<P>The Classviewer's best strength is providing a fast and good access to his code by the code's contents independent of the location
within files. Therefore, selections by a mouse click will result in the following actions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>On a classname:</B>  Switches to the class declaration</LI>
<LI><B>On a class method:</B> Switches to the method implementation</LI>
<LI><B>On a class attribute:</B> Switches to the attibute's declaration in the class declaration</LI>
<LI><B>On a struct:</B> Switches to the struct's declaration</LI>
<LI><B>On a global function:</B> Switches to the function's implementation</LI>
</UL>
<P>Now, this provides you the most needed access towards code objects. Apparently, it may be needed to change a method's header, resulting
that you have to change it's declaration in the class as well as the implementation. The classviewer supports this by providing
right-button context menus over items. On a method or function, this means that you can select where to go:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Go to definition:</B> Switches to the implementation- this is the default for a left click as described above</LI>
<LI><B>Go to declaration:</B> Switches to the declaration of the method or function.</LI>
</UL>
<P>By this behavoir, the classbrowser offers you access to every place you have to go for coding your C++ application.
<P>The following sections give you a description of the other tools that the Classbrowser offers- you will find them very useful when
working with large projects as they enhance working object-orientated on C++ programs.
