<H3><A NAME="s5">5. User Control Elements</A></H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Other Widgets</A>
</H3>

<P>Control elements are used within visible areas of the application and can be combined together to create a dialog or view. Beyond the
control elements that the Qt library provides, KDE offers:
<P>KButton: active raise-lower button
KButtonBox: manages buttons
KColorButton: button displaying a color setting
KCombo: similar to QComboBox
KDatePicker: Date selection widget
KIntegerLine: lineedit that only accepts integer values
KLedLamp: LED lamp
KLined: line edit
KPanner: panner devider
KNewPanner: panner devider managing two widgets
KPopupMenu: popup menu with title
KRestrictedLine: lineedit that only accepts certain input
KSelector: value selector
KSeparator: standard separator
KSlider: slider widget
KSpinBox: like QSpinBox
KTabCtl: tabulator widget
KTreeList: tree list widget
<P>
<H3><A NAME="The Menubar"></A> <A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 The Menubar</A>
</H3>

<P>The menubar is a central component of the main window. It allows the user to execute operations that the application (or to be precise:
the mainview) offers in regards of manipulating the main view's contents. In opposition to Qt's <CODE>QMenuBar</CODE>, KDE offers the use of
the class <CODE>KMenubar</CODE>. Additionally, the menubar is already constructed for the programmer when using <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE> with the
first call of <CODE>menuBar()</CODE>.
<P>The menubar itself, independent which class is going to be used, contains entries that the user can select with the mouse or by using
keyboard accelerators with the ALT-key and the underlined character. The menus that have to pop up on a selection have to be created
with the class <CODE>QPopupMenu</CODE>, which itself only provides the popups, entries have to be inserted using the methods provided by
<CODE>QMenuData</CODE>.
<P>Mind that menubars should always contain all functions a program has to offer except those that can be accessed by additional dialogs.
The menubar also makes use of the <CODE>KApplication</CODE> help menu already provided. Inserting the menu is just easy with
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
menuBar()->insertItem(i18n("Help"), kapp->getHelpMenu());
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 The Toolbar</A>
</H3>

<P>Toolbars are another component that enhances user interaction with symbols representing most needed functions that an application
provides. The KDE libraries are again offering another class to use with KDE applications, <CODE>KToolBar</CODE>; when using <CODE>KTMainWindow</CODE>
these are created like the menubar by the first call of <CODE>toolBar()</CODE>. As you can use as many toolbars as your application requires,
you can create them with the number in the <CODE>toolBar()</CODE> method; if the method's paramenter is empty, the first toolbar number is 0.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 The Statusbar</A>
</H3>

<P>KDE also provides the pendant to Qt's <CODE>QStatusBar</CODE>, <CODE>KStatusBar</CODE>. The statusbar can contain labels as well as widgets, such as
progressbars (those have to have the statusbar as parent). The statusbar is used to display information about the current state of the
application and gives hints about the usage of commands e.g. over toolbars and menubars.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Keyboard Accelerators"></A> <A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Keyboard Accelerators</A>
</H3>

<P>KKeyDialog: keyboard accelerator configuration dialog
<P>KKeyChooser
<P>KAccel
