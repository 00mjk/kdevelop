<H3><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Documentation Browser</A>
</H3>

<P>The Documentation Browser can be configured by this menu,setting colors for HTML links, background etc.
Also the font size can be changed as well as the fixed and standard font type according to the system's installed fonts.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Printer Setup</A>
</H3>

<P>The printer can be configured to use the printing programs a2ps and enscript, so please make sure that either one of them is
installed on your system. The configuration is almost similar for both programs, but the options must be set differently by
using the corresponding configuration dialogs.

<P>
<H4>General</H4>

<P><B>Make-command:</B>
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time your're invoking a make command.
<P><B>Autosave:</B>
<P>If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.
<P>
<P><B>Autoswitch:</B>
<P>If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to a
documentation in the Helpmenu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the output
window turned off.
Startup:
<P>For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the startlogo to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavoir.

<H4><A NAME="Changing Keyboard Shortcuts"></A> Changing Keyboard Shortcuts </H4>

<P>The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.

<H4>Documentation</H4>

<P>
<H4>Directories</H4>

<P>
<P>For setting up the documentation browser to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML- documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML
as well as the path to the KDE-library documentation.
<P>Usually, the Qt-documentation is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the
documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the
according buttons, displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should
first enter the next configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice,
also setting the KDE Library Doc path automatically.
<P>
<H4>Options</H4>

<P>
<H4>Update KDE-Documentation</H4>

<P>For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the files
installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations. This
function requires your system to have kdoc and qt2kdoc installed, included in the kdesdk package. First of, you have to set
up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE ! Just enter the path to the sources, like:
/home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/.
<P>Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentationpath:  this assumes that youalready have a documentation
installed and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the
newly generated documentation into the recent path.</LI>
<LI> Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentationpath:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as
well as above, but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.</LI>
<LI> Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of
the kdelibs documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older
kdelibs version.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for
users who generate a new documentation from scratch.
<P>After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "kdoc-reference" in the documentation path containing the kdoc
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the
documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure
that it can be found by qt2kdoc. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with crossreferences to
give browsing the most functionality.
<P>
<H4>Create Search Database</H4>

<P>The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a
keyword interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse 4.1 installed.
Preset are the options to index the given KDE-library documentation as well as the Qt-documentation, assuming the path to the
documentation files were set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include
directories the user can set up himself by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an addional
directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path
in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and
medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger searchdatabase
will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size. For using the search function, see section
Using the Documentation Browser
