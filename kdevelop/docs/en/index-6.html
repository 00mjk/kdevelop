<a NAME="s6"></a>6. Questions and Answers</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><b>Q :</b> I have a question which is not adressed in the FAQ file,
nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?
<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp; In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop
to the KDevelop mailinglist which adress can be found on the KDevelop homepage.&nbsp;
All questions should go there and will be adressed there as well.&nbsp;
If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and
all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep the FAQ
up to date.

<p><b>Q:</b> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects
62
<br><b>A:&nbsp;</b> There are 2 ways.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. : When the kdelibs are
installed it installs header files for the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jpeg libraries, these are
version 61,&nbsp; however most distributions
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Redhat) use version 62
libraries. To fix&nbsp; this just remove jpeglib.h
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from /opt/kde/include. The
pukka include&nbsp; file for version 62 should
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then be picked up. However
looking at the&nbsp; error message above it may
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be the other way round,
in any case ensure&nbsp; you only have on version
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the header file, the
library and that&nbsp; they are consistent.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is useful to use the locate
command to verify that I have
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the correct version of a
library and header files e.g.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; updatedb
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locate libjpeg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locate jpeglib
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2: You must recompiled kdesupport
without jpeg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library (configure --with-libjpeg
--with-libgif).
<p>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/kdevelop-0.3/po'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd .. &amp;&amp; automake --gnu --include-deps po/Makefile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aclocal.m4: 2709: `AM_PROG_INSTALL' is obsolete;
use `AC_PROG_INSTALL'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make[2]: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1
<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Workaround for automake-1.4/automake-2.13 users: Just
run
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "aclocal" manually, then it will compile.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; What must i do, if configure said ,that i need giflib23.
<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Try a newer snap of kdesupport, or maybe you have another
giflib installed?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q:</b> How can I convert a KDevelop 0.2 project to a 0.3 one?
<br><b>A:</b> Please change the AC_OUTPUT in the configure.in to a oneline
version
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; for example:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; old version AC_OUTPUT(Makefile \
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile \
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
kdevelop/templates/Makefile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; )
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; new version: AC_OUTPUT(Makefile kdevelop/kwrite/Makefile
kdevelop/templates/Makefile)
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; I&nbsp; get the following linker errors, what do I have
to do to get KDevelop linked ?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/lib/libqt.so:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warning: multiple common

<br>make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
<p><b>A:</b> If you have the SuSE rpm&acute;s of KDE-1.1, you must recompile
the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall them.&nbsp;
.:-(
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a bug in the SuSE rpm's.
<br>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Q:</b> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete
key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).
<br><b>A:</b>&nbsp; go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete
on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q:</b> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included
and compiled ?
<br><b>A: </b>Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you
make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new added
files will be included as well.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Q:</b> If I removed a file, I get some weird linker messages. What
is wrong with my project ?
<br><b>A:</b> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically
processed by automoc&nbsp;(running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler automatically
on all headers),
<br>your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file
and compiled.&nbsp; Remove the according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the
project.
