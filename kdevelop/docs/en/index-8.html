<h2>
<a NAME="s8"></a>8. Thanks</h2>
We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends
who supported us in several ways to let us construct and improve KDevelop.
<p>Further, we thank&nbsp; Jochen Wilhelmy&nbsp; for offering his program
kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.
<p>Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility
to work on KDevelop via CVS (and had to suffer some trouble for that...).
