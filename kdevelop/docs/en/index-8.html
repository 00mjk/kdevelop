<P>KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to
delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all
information for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status and compiler options (CXXFLAGS). Setting
file properties allows you to keep track of where the files should go.
<P>With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard
generates three kinds of fram applications, as:
<UL>
<LI>a single document interface (SDI) KDE-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control
resource management to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE 1.1 application. The application frame also
contains statusbar help messages as known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view,
it is based on three application-specific classes leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base
classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least created most logical to create applications with a GUI.
</LI>
<LI>a KDE-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their
program from scratch, but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.
</LI>
<LI>a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the Qt library as the GUI interface alone, we
tried to offer you a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should
have no problems to create a full-functional application by using Qt only.
</LI>
<LI>a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting to write a terminal based C++ program. Just
remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as for KDE applications.</LI>
</UL>

For importing existing applications, we suggest using the New Project option. Select "Project" from the menubar and select "New".
The New Project dialog offers creates a project directory and subdirectories as well as the project file with the project name and
type. We advise copying all needed creation files like configure.in, Makefile.am's etc. into the project directory from your
existing project and choose "Project"->"Add file(s)"->"Add existing file(s)" to copy the sources into your new project directory.
Note that your Makefile.am's will be changed by KDevelop and you probably will have to change or delete some entries to provide
clean compilation. You should not edit the KDevelop write area, instead you should read the entries made by KDevelop and delete
matching titles created yourself. Also note that only one project is supported to work on at the moment, so your source files
should be in the project's subdirectory which has the same name as the main project directory. In the Logical File Viewer the
groups have to be set by yourself if you chose to use that importing possibility. Another way could be to create a frame
application and delete the created source and header files. Then you can add existing files as above.
<P>
<H4>Creating Libraries</H4>

<P>This type of project isn't supported at the moment. This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions of
KDevelop.

<H3><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 New Projects with KAppWizard</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of four different types of projects, constructing a framework for each. All
projects are FSF-compliant and use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements section of this handbook.
<P>For KDE applications, the wizard offers two different frameworks, the KDE-Application, providing a complete application with base
classes for document type, view and application. This includes the creation of a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, the mainwindow
inherits the KTMainWindow class. The KDE-Mini-Application only gives a view which is empty. This type of project can be used for
the creation of small desktop tools or other simple applications without too much change on the existing code provided by the
framework. A Qt-Application offers the creation of a Qt-only program if you wish no dependencies towards the KDE-libraries for
end-users. (NOTE: The configure script still checks for the KDE-libraries.  This will be fixed in the next version of KDevelop).        
<P>The Qt-Application also is created by using tree base classes like the KDE-standard-Application and provides a menubar, toolbar
and statusbar.
<P>The C++ -Application type offers a framework for creating commandline applications.  It is ready to run and by default displays
"Hello World" as the only action.  This may be useful for C++ learners who would like to program applications without using a GUI
first or for those working on commandline programs written in C++ or C.
<P>The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Furher, your Name and
Email adress are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the
*.lsm file.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Porting existing projects</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Existing projects can be converted to KDevelop projects by selecting "New" from the project menu.  The following dialog creates an
empty project file with your project name, version and type information as well as your name and email adress.  Then copy all your
compilation and construction files to the new project directory and choose "Add Files" from the project menu.  The files selected
will be copied into your project directory and the makefile.am's are updated.   Please change all Makefile.am entries existing
before the conversion towards the now created entries done by KDevelop in the KDevelop area.  Test, if your program can still be
compiled and installed after the conversion to ensure the project's consistancy.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 Adding Files and Classes</A>
</H3>

<P>Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation file into several ones. Then you
need to create an new file which will get the part of the class implementation you want to move. You can specify which type the
new file will be, including a template for pixmap files often needed to create new toolbar icons. The new file will be added to
the project and all affected project files like Makefile.am etc will be updated.

<H3><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 Setting Project File Options</A>
</H3>

<P>The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project
files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is
included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install
command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when the
project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those locations.   For standard KDE location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss8.9">8.9 General Project Options</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The Project Options dialog , accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
updated in the makefile.am's and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings ).  After changing the
project options, you should invoke "make clean" or "rebuild all" to compile your project with the new options.  Please mind that
debugging is only available if the project options are set to create debugging information, the amount can be set with the debug
level (0-3). If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included in the linker flags, your program will not link
correctly if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.
