<H3><A NAME="Configuring Menubars and Toolbars"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. Configuring Menubars and Toolbars</A></H3>

<P>Menubars and toolbars are one of the most important parts of an application to provide methods to work with a document structure. As a
general rule, you should make all functions availabele by the menubar. Those methods that should not be available at a current stage of
the application process should be disabled.
<P>Further, an appliation can only contain one menubar, but several toolbars. Toolbars on the other hand should contain only the most
recently used commands by pixmap icons or provide quick access methods like combos to select values.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 How does it work ?</A>
</H3>

<P>Each entry, may it be a menuentry or a toolbar item, has a resource ID which is an integer value. As these values can't be used twice,
those are set by macros, where the numeric values are replaced by a descriptive ID name that can be used in your sources then.
<P>All resource ID's are collected in the file <CODE>resource.h</CODE>, where you can keep an overview over the used values. Anyway, the compiler
will inform you if you've used a value twice for constructing entries. Also, the resource file should contain all menu accelerators by
IDK macro replacements. An example:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
(resource.h)

#define ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR             12010


(kscribble.cpp)

// menu entry Toolbar in the "view" menubar menu
view_menu->insertItem(i18n("&amp;Toolbar"), ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR);
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This inserts the entry Toolbar to the View popup menu of the menubar in the kscribble application. The resource ID's name is held to
contain the menu name and the action's name visible. The ampersand is set in front of the letter that functions as a keyboard
accelerator and the entry itself is embraced by the i18n() internationalization macro.
<P>On activating the menu item, the commandCallback() switch is called with the ID number. There, you have to add an according comparator
value with the method you want to execute on activating the menuentry:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
    case ID_VIEW_TOOLBAR:
        slotViewToolBar();
        break;
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Adding a new menu</A>
</H3>

<P>A new menubar is added to an application by the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>add a pointer to the new menu in the App-class header</LI>
<LI>call the constructor of <CODE>QPopupMenu</CODE> to the pointer in <CODE>initMenuBar()</CODE> at the location where your menubar should appear
later.</LI>
<LI>insert the according menuitems into the popup menu and set their resource ID's in the resource file</LI>
<LI>add connects for <CODE>commandCallback()</CODE> and <CODE>statusCallback()</CODE> to the menu at the end of <CODE>initMenuBar()</CODE></LI>
<LI>add the methods you want to call by the menuentries in the header and implementation file.</LI>
<LI>add the switch statements for the entries to the <CODE>commandCallback()</CODE> and <CODE>statusCallback()</CODE> methods</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Integrating Toolbar buttons</A>
</H3>

<P>Toolbar buttons can be added like menuentries with the difference that the used method is <CODE>insertButton()</CODE> and takes a button
pixmap and tooltip text instead of a menu text.
<P>The icons you want to use can be loaded by <CODE>KIconLoader</CODE>, where <CODE>KApplication</CODE> offers the macros <CODE>ICON()</CODE> and <CODE>Icon()</CODE> to
access the icon loader and load the icon. These macros take the filename of the pixmap as their parameter to load the icon from the KDE
file system in a certain order (see <CODE>KIconLoader</CODE> for the search order).
<P>The KDE libraries also offer a set of toolbar buttons that can be used for standard actions. In cases where they don't meet your needs,
you will have to paint your own pixmaps. KDevelop supports this by selecting "New" from the "File" menu, then select Pixmap as the file
type. Usually you will place your toolbar pixmaps in a project subdirectory "toolbar" and install them into your application specific
toolbar directory.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Configuring Statusbars</A>
</H3>

<P>The KDevelop projects already make use of the statusbar by providing statusbar messages for menuentries and toolbar buttons. When
adding a menuentry, also add your statusmessage in the method <CODE>statusCallback()</CODE>.
<P><CODE>statusCallback()</CODE> uses the method <CODE>slotStatusHelpMsg()</CODE> to display a statusbar message for two seconds. When executing a
command, you should use the method <CODE>slotStatusMsg()</CODE> at the beginning with the string describing what your application does; before
a return or method end, you should reset the statusbar message with a "Ready." string calling the same method.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Keyboard Accelerator Configuration</A>
</H3>

<P>A very professional thing you should always add to your application are keyboard accelerators. Those are mainly used by experienced
users that want to work fast with their applications and are willing to learn shortcuts. For this, the KDE libraries provide the class
<CODE>KAccel</CODE>, which provides the keyboard accelerator keys and access to global configured standard keyboard accelerators.
<P>By default, frame applications generated by KDevelop only use standard keyboard accelerators such as F1 for acessing online-help,
Ctrl+N for New File etc. You should look for the keyboard accelerators already set in <CODE>KAccel</CODE> first before adding a new
accelerator.
<P>If your application contains a lot of accelerators, you should make them configurable by an Options-menu; either it could be combined
with other application configuration in a <CODE>QTabDialog</CODE> or stand alone. The KDE libarary already provides a <CODE>KKeyChooser</CODE> for use
in tab dialogs, whereas <CODE>KKeyDialog</CODE> provides a ready-to use key-configuration dialog.
<P>See the following classes for more information:
<P><CODE>KAccel</CODE>(kdecore), <CODE>KKeyChooser</CODE>, <CODE>KKeyDialog</CODE> (kdeui)
