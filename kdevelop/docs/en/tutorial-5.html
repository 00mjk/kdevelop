<H3><A NAME="s5">5. Qt-Applications</A></H3>

<P>The Qt library, on which KDE is based, offers a lot of possibilities towards programming GUI based applications. For commericial development, Qt seems
to be a good alternative due to the fact of it's easy use and it's cross-platform availability. Therefore, and basically by the fact that from version 2.x
Qt is published under a new license, we assume that development using this library will reach a far more wider community of developers than those already
taking advantage of it, we included direct support for a project type based on the Qt library alone. The framecode which is offered is almost similar to
the structure of that which is generated for a KDE application, just the derived classes have been changed and a Qt-based program won't take advantage of the
possibilities that a full-featured KDE program can offer like e.g. session management.
