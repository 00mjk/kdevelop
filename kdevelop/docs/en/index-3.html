<BLOCKQUOTE>Notice: KQuickhelp is available nearly everywhere!&nbsp; Just
click on anything with your right mouse-button to get this.
<BR>If KDevelop starts for the first time, you get the main window with
an empty file/classbrowser and output field.&nbsp; First of all, you should
configure KDevelop to give the documetation browser access to the KDE and
QT documentation by&nbsp; invoking&nbsp; the setup dialog via "Options"-
"Configure KDevelop":

<BR><B><I>Picture 1: The KDevelop Setup dialog configures the documentation
paths</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If you don't have a KDE-libs Documentation, especially if you use current
snapshots, don't worry.&nbsp; Just switch to "Documentation"-"Update KDE-Documentation"
<BR>This will offer you the following dialog field, where you have a various
set of options to generate you a Documentation of your recent KDE-libs.

generation of new KDE-libs documentation</I></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;Each new project will be created using KAppWizard by "File"- "New
Project":

<P><IMG SRC="kappwiz.gif" HEIGHT=428 WIDTH=408>
<BR><B><I>Picture 3: Startpage of the application wizard</I></B>

<P>KAppWizard leads you through several steps towards creating a frame
application which you can work on.&nbsp; When the wizard is finished, files
are copied to your development directory and classnames adapted to your
application name.&nbsp; Your work starts like this (where KBase is the
name of your application):

<P><IMG SRC="kdevwork.gif" HEIGHT=569 WIDTH=707>
<BR><B><I>Picture 3: the working environment after creation of a frame
for the application KBase</I></B>

<P>As you can see, we already switched to the documentation view of the
Application KBase.&nbsp; It already contains three classes:
<BR>- KBaseApp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inherits KTMainWindow and contains the
code for the menubar, toolbar and statusbar and creates instances of the
other classes
<BR>- KBaseDoc:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inherits QObject&nbsp; as a general
class so it is SIGNAL-SLOT enabled (see QT Documentation).&nbsp; The document
stores all data which it gets from
<BR>- KBaseView:&nbsp;&nbsp; inherits QWidget.&nbsp; On itself, it creates
an empty widget which you have to set up by implementing childwidgets or
a complete new widget.

<P>All files can be accessed by clicking on the filename on the left panner-
the file opens automatically in the right tab of the right side for editing.

<P>TODO:&nbsp; Go ahead and write a new application for the KDE-project
!

<P>You may visit the <A HREF="tutorial.html">tutorials</A> about how to
expand your frame application to a full-featured KDE-app.

<P>Have fun using KDevelop !!</BLOCKQUOTE>
