<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Configuration </A></H3>

<P>This section describes how to set up KDevelop to make programming a real enjoyment.
We suggest following each step of configuration in the given order.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Editor</A>
</H3>

<P>The integrated editor of KDevelop is based on KWrite, known as the "Extended Editor"  in KDE-1.1.
The options dialog configures the main behavoir for the editor regarding things as selections, wrapping etc.
<P>Edit Options:
<P>Auto Indent:                       this sets the edior to place the cursor below the first literal when a new line is entered.
Backspace Indent:             this option sets the cursor below the first literal of the line above when backspace is pressed.
Word Wrap:                        words are taken into the next line after the column set in "Wrap Words At:"
Replace Tabs                     tabulators in the current text are replaced with tabulators of the "Tab Width:" value
Remove Trailing Spaces:   removes trailing spaces
Wrap Cursor:                      sets the cursor to the end of the last line when backspace enters the beginning of a line
Auto Brackets:                   creates a closing bracket in front of the cursor when a bracket (any kind) is opened.
<P>Select Options:
<P>Persistent Selections:        selections made stay marked after setting the cursor to a different place
Multiple Selections:           allows multiple independent selections within the text
Vertical Selections:            when selecting multiple lines, the selection is also made horizontal and doesn't cover the whole line
Delete On Input:                 deletes a selection when writing in the selection.
Toggle Old:                          allows only one selection. A selection made gets deselected when another selection is made.
<P>Wrap Words At:                      sets the maximum
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Editor Colors</A>
</H3>

<P>The editor allows to configure the general view of the editing field by choosing colors for:
- background:                the editor's background
- text background:        the background of displayed text
- selected:                     the color of selected text to display the selection
- found:                          the color of text found by a search via the menu "View"-"Search", "Repeat search" and "Replace".
- selected + found:        the color of text selected to search for and found
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Editor Defaults</A>
</H3>

<P>The Editor Defaults dialog lets you configure the default values for language items such as keywords etc.
and the default font style.  When setting up the syntax highlighting (see below), those default values can be used
to configure standard values configured here.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Syntax-Highlighting</A>
</H3>

<P>The Syntax-Highlighting configurations dialog allows settings for different programming languages and fonts, each independent.
To change the preset syntax-highlighting for a language, choose the language and the idiom wich display type you want to change.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Documentation Browser</A>
</H3>

<P>The Documentation Browser can be configured by this menu,setting colors for HTML links, background etc.
Also the font size can be changed as well as the fixed and standard font type according to the system's installed fonts.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Printer Setup</A>
</H3>

<P>The printer can be configured to use the printing programs a2ps and enscript, so please make sure that either one of them is
installed on your system. The configuration is almost similar for both programs, but the options must be set differently by
using the corresponding configuration dialogs.
<H3><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 KDevelop Setup</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>General</H4>

<P>Make-command:
The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If the selected program does not exist,
KDevelop will warn you the next time your're invoking a make command.
<P>Autosave:
<P>If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.  The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.
<P>
<P>Autoswitch:
<P>If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off according to the usage context, e.g.  if you switch to
a documentation in the Helpmenu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with the documentation tree and the output window turned off.
<P>
<P>Startup:
<P>For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the startlogo to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.
Further, if you don't like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default behavoir.
<P>
<H4>Keys</H4>

<P>The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the
KDE Control Center, such as open file and print.  A key function can be configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the
configuration can be changed by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.
<P>
<H4>Documentation</H4>

<P>
<H4>Directories</H4>

<P>
<P>For setting up the documentation browser to work correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML- documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML
as well as the path to the KDE-library documentation.
<P>Usually, the Qt-documentation is placed in the same directory where Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path
you have to enter is /usr/local/qt/html. For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root of the documentation,
assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the same directory. Both path's can be selected by pressing the according buttons,
displaying a path-selection. If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,  you should first enter the next
configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation. This will create the documentation to a path of your choice, also setting the KDE Library
Doc path automatically.
<P>
<H4>Options</H4>

<P>Update KDE-Documentation
<P>For those users who don't have a recent documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the files installed
on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates a new one or updates existing documentations.
<P>This function requires your system to have kdoc and qt2kdoc installed, included in the kdesdk package.
First of, you have to set up the path to your recent kdelibs sources, which is not the include-path for KDE !
Just enter the path to the sources, like:  /home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/ .     Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:
<P>- Delete old Documentation and  install to recent Documentationpath:  this assumes that youalready have a documentation installed
and is placed in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete all documentation and install the newly generated
documentation into the recent path.
<P>- Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentationpath:   this will result in deleting the old documentation as well as above,
but gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.
<P>- Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation path:   This is recommended for a new generation of the kdelibs
documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want to keep the last documentation for an older kdelibs version.
<P>The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set  for option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.  This is also recommended for users
who generate a new documentation from scratch.
<P>After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "kdoc-reference" in the documentation path containing the kdoc
reference files.  First, the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt documentation with the documentation to
be generated for the kdelibs.  So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first to ensure that it can be found by
qt2kdoc. Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be build with crossreferences to give browsing the most functionality.
<P>
<P>
<P>Create Search Database
The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for a keyword
interactively.  To create and use the documentation search function, you must have the program glimpse 4.1 installed.  Preset are the
options to index the given KDE-library documentation as well as the Qt-documentation, assuming the path to the documentation files were
set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.   Additionally, the index can include directories the user can set up himself
by the "additional directories to index"-field.  After setting a path to an addional directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set
the path.  A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting the path in the path field and pushing "Remove". Furthermore, the
user is offered three different modes for the index size: tiny, small and medium.  The higher the index size, the more the index files
will grow. On the other hand, a search in a bigger searchdatabase will be faster and more successful, so we suggest choosing a "medium" size.
For using the search function, see section  4.8   Using the Documentation Browser
