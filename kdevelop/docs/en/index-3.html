<H3><A NAME="Programs"></A> <A NAME="s3">3. Programs</A></H3>

<P>Now that KDevelop installed successfully and the most commonly used options are set, you are probably wondering if it keeps what
it promises. This Chapter gives you a guideline to how programs are created using the GNU tools in general and especially what
part KDevelop plays in this game.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="The Compiler"></A> <A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 The Compiler</A>
 </H3>

<P>The compiler is actually the program on your system that has to be installed as a minimum to create running programs; he is the
one that compiles the sourcecode into object files and creates the program.
<P>Normally, you would start like this:
Open an editor of your choice - don't use a word-processor. Type in something like this to create the source for your first
program:
<P><CODE>
<PRE>
#include &lt;iostream.h>

int main(){

cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;

}
</PRE>
</CODE>
Well, actually all the program will do is to print out the string "Hello World" to your standard output. But this is just the
sourcecode for the program to be build, not the program itself. Therefore, we need a compiler, in this case a C++-compiler like
g++. Then we can save the file with the sourcecode, as, let's say, myprogram.cpp and invoke the compiler with the filename (on a
console): <CODE>
<PRE>
g++ -o myprogram.cpp myprogram
</PRE>
</CODE>
Then we can start our program- just type <CODE>myprogram</CODE>  on the console, and the program prints out the string; then exits.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Make"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Make and Makefiles</A>
</H3>

<P>I have everything I need: an editor, a compiler and I can execute my own C++
program. But it isn't all that easy. What happens if you have more than one sourcefile ? And, do you have to compile all sources
over and over again only if you changed one file ?  Compiling will become more and more complicated, because you have to type in
all the commands and options yourself. Therefore, you could write a so-called "Makefile". You could also call it some other
name except the name of the program to build. Then, you should have the tool <CODE>make</CODE> or <CODE>gmake</CODE> installed, or any other tool
that is capable of keeping track of a project's compilation. Insert all your compiler commands in a certain syntax into that
Makefile and save it; then you will only have to type <CODE>make</CODE> or <CODE>gmake</CODE> on the console in the directory where your Makefile
is located, and then make takes over, leading the compiler to create your application.
The make utility has many other advantages and can be used to a lot of purposes. To get a complete overview, open a console and
type:
<P><CODE>man make</CODE>
<P>or search for "GNU Make" in KDEHelp, "System GNU Info contents".
At least, you have an insight, why a developer needs the make utility for making it easier to compile his application.
Now, writing Makefiles is not only handwork until now, you also have to dig yourself into the whole syntax and options. But here
is the good news about KDevelop and any Make-utility: You just have to set the Make-Command in the 
<@@ref>KDevelop SetupKDevelop Setup</A> dialog, and then you're done. All projects generated with KDevelop will use that Make command to build the
target application, and no typing at all. Just hit the buttons on the toolbar of KDevelop, beginning with the one after the second
separator line, or choose the desired function for Make in the "Build" menu.
<P>The toolbar and the build-menu then offer the most-common functions that you need to let make do the dirty work:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Compile File: is only active if you're working on a source file. It invokes make with the correct command to compile only
the current source.</LI>
<LI> Make: just calles make and creates your target.</LI>
<LI> Rebuild all: rebuilds the whole project</LI>
<LI> Clean/Rebuild all: cleans the project directory first and then runs make again.</LI>
<LI> Stop Build: cancels the current process- this is mostly used if you watch make working and staring at your sources. Then-
ahh- I forgot about this line...and you have to correct your code. Just hit Stop, correct the error you found by yourself and run
Make again.</LI>
</UL>
<P>But this is not the only way how KDevelop works together with make- for KDE applications, there are some things that are special,
like creating the message files for internationalization. These functions are also included, so no worry about these things
anymore.
<P>Until now, you know about sources, the compiler and why make is needed. In the next section, we'll discuss how it comes that
projects created with KDevelop automatically can be compiled on most other Unix-platforms using the <CODE>configure-</CODE> script.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Configure"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Configure</A>
</H3>

<P>The title of this section lets you probably question: Configure ? What has to be configured ? Or who ?
Well, assume you have written a program, and you have written your Makefile by hand. Then you like to distribute it, but the
binary compiled does only run on your system or on systems that are compatible with yours. To support other platforms like other
Unix-systems or other machines like Alpha's or RISC's, the program has to be recompiled. The easiest way would be to copy the
source package to the target machine and run make again. But what if the target machine uses another compiler command or has in
some other way a problem to build your binary ?
<P>In this case, you would have to rewrite the Makefile to allow a compilation.
