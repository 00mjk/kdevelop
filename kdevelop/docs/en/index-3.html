<P>For programming beginners Unix systems seems like a threat as you have to get comfortable with the standard Unix-development tools
like the compilers, makefiles, automake and autoconf. Additionally, a GUI- what a mass of information to learn and understand.
Getting used to the programming languages C and C++ alone is work enough for a lot of computer enthusiasts to loose interest in
computing software. So most of those who are still willing to develop a useful application have to endure the lack of an
easy-to-use development environment, thus wasting a lot of time creating single files with editors, writing simple Makefiles and
quarreling with browsers to get access to library documentation, searching header files for functions and classes they want to
use- if you get that far.       The K Desktop Environment makes things a lot easier for users as well as for programmers, but doesn't
solve all problems. You can create a KDE-libs documentation with kdoc, but this is it. Some example programs provided with the
kdesdk , giving you a short overview about how you may start developing a KDE application, some frame-application generators do
the basic work. But what is beyond that ? You're still confronted with the problems mentioned above.
