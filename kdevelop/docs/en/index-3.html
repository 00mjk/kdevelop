<a NAME="s3"></a>3. Configuration</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section describes how to set up KDevelop
to make programming a real enjoyment.&nbsp; We suggest following each step
of configuration in the given order.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.1"></a>3.1 Editor</h2>

<blockquote>The integrated editor of KDevelop is based on KWrite, known
as the "Extended Editor"&nbsp; in KDE-1.1.
<br>The options dialog configures the main behavoir for the editor regarding
things as selections, wrapping etc.
<p>Edit Options:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auto Indent:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this sets the edior to place the cursor below the first literal when a
new line is entered.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Backspace Indent:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this option sets the cursor below the first literal of the line above when
backspace is pressed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word Wrap:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
words are taken into the next line after the column set in "Wrap Words
At:"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace Tabs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
tabulators in the current text are replaced with tabulators of the "Tab
Width:" value
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove Trailing Spaces:&nbsp;&nbsp; removes trailing
spaces
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wrap Cursor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of a line
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auto Brackets:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
creates a closing bracket in front of the cursor when a bracket (any kind)
is opened.
<p>Select Options:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Persistent Selections:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
selections made stay marked after setting the cursor to a different place
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple Selections:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
allows multiple independent selections within the text
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vertical Selections:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when selecting multiple lines, the selection is also made horizontal and

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.2"></a>3.2&nbsp; Editor-Colors</h2>

<blockquote>The editor allows to configure the general view of the editing
field by choosing colors for:
<br>- background:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the editor's background
<br>- text background:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the background

the color of text found by a search via the menu "View"-"Search", "Repeat
search" and "Replace".
<br>- selected + found:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the color

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.3"></a>3.3 Editor Defaults</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Editor Defaults dialog lets you configure
the default values for language items such as keywords etc. and the default
font style.&nbsp; When setting up the syntax highlighting (see below),
those default values can be used to configure standard values configured
here.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.4"></a>3.4&nbsp; Syntax-Highlighting</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Syntax-Highlighting configurations dialog
allows settings for different programming languages and fonts, each independent.
<br>To change the preset syntax-highlighting for a language, choose the
language and the idiom wich display type you want to change.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.5"></a>3.5&nbsp; Documentation Browser</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Documentation Browser can be configured
by this menu, setting colors for HTML links, background etc. Also the font
size can be changed as well as the fixed and standard font type according
to the system's installed fonts.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.6"></a>3.6&nbsp; Configure Printer...</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer can be configured to use the printing programs
a2ps and enscript, so please make sure that either one of them is installed
on your system.
<br>The configuration is almost similar for both programs, but the options
must be set differently by using the corresponding configuration dialogs.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="ss3.7"></a>3.7&nbsp; KDevelop Setup</h2>

<blockquote>
<h4>
<a NAME="ss3.7.1"></a>3.7.1&nbsp; General</h4>

<blockquote>Make-command:
<p>The General Options dialog lets you configure KDevelop's general settings.
<br>First, you should set the make-command available on your system. If
the selected program does not exist, KDevelop will warn you the next time
your're invoking a make command.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Autosave:
<p>If Autosave is checked, KDevelop will save all changed files periodically.&nbsp;
The autosaving time range can be set to 3, 5, 15 or 30 minutes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Autoswitch:
<p>If Autoswitch is enabled, the KDevelop windows will switch on and off
according to the usage context, e.g.&nbsp; if you switch to a documentation
in the Helpmenu, the Documentation browser will be opened, together with
the documentation tree and the output window turned off.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Startup:
<p>For starting KDevelop, you have the option to enable/disable the startlogo
to be shown during the time KDevelop loads.&nbsp; Further, if you don't
like the last project to be opened on startup, you can disable the default
behavoir.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="ss3.7.2"></a>3.7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keys</h4>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Configure Keys dialog lets you configure the
KDevelop key bindings. Note that global keys can be configured in the KDE
Control Center, such as open file and print.&nbsp; A key function can be
configured by choosing the menu entry. Then the configuration can be changed
by checking values like the Alt / Ctrl key etc.</blockquote>

<h4>
<a NAME="ss3.7.3"></a>3.7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation</h4>

<h4>
3.7.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Directories</h4>

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For setting up the documentation browser to work
correctly, KDevelop needs some information about where the HTML- documentation
is placed on the system. Therefore, the Documentation Path properties dialog
needs the path of the Qt- online documentation in HTML as well as the path
to the KDE-library documentation.
<p>Usually, the Qt-documentation is placed in the same directory where
Qt is installed; e.g. if Qt resides in /usr/local/qt, the path you have
to enter is /usr/local/qt/html.
<br>For the KDE- Documentation, you have to set the directory to the root
of the documentation, assumed all KDE-Libs documentation resides in the
same directory.
<br>Both path's can be selected by pressing the according buttons, displaying
a path-selection.
<br>If your system doesn't contain the documentation for the KDE-libs,&nbsp;
you should first enter the next configuration dialog, Update KDE-Documentation.
This will create the documentation to a path of your choice, also setting
the KDE Library Doc path automatically.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h4>
3.7.3.2&nbsp; Options</h4>

<h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update
KDE-Documentation</h4>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those users who don't have a recent
documentation of the KDE-libraries, especially the documentation for the
files installed on the system, the Update KDE-Documentation dialog creates
a new one or updates existing documentations.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>This function requires your system to have kdoc and qt2kdoc installed,
included in the kdesdk package.
<br>First of, you have to set up the path to your recent kdelibs sources,
which is not the include-path for KDE !&nbsp; Just enter the path to the
sources, like:&nbsp; /home/rnolden/kdelibs-1.1/ .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then, you can choose three different installation modes, as:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp; Delete old Documentation and&nbsp; install to recent Documentationpath:&nbsp;
this assumes that youalready have a documentation installed and is placed
in the path the Documentation Path-dialog was entered. This will delete
all documentation and install the newly generated documentation into the
recent path.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Delete old Documentation and install to new Documentationpath:&nbsp;&nbsp;
this will result in deleting theolddocumentation as well as above, but
gives you the choice to set up a new documentation place.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave old Documentation untouched and install to new Documentation
path:&nbsp;&nbsp; This is recommended for a new generation of the kdelibs
documentation for users who didn't have one before and for those who want
to keep the last documentation for an older kdelibs version.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>The "new KDE Libs Documentation path" is to be set&nbsp; for
option 2 and 3 of the installation mode.&nbsp; This is also recommended
for users who generate a new documentation from scratch.
<p>After pressing the OK button, KDevelop will create a subdirectory "kdoc-reference"
in the documentation path containing the kdoc reference files.&nbsp; First,
the qt library documentation classes will be indexed to connect the Qt
documentation with the documentation to be generated for the kdelibs.&nbsp;
So it is important that you have set up the Qt documentation path first
to ensure that it can be found by qt2kdoc.
<br>Finally, the KDE libs will be indexed and the documentation will be
build with crossreferences to give browsing the most functionality.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Create Search Database</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Create Search Database dialog, accessed via the
create-button, allows the programmer to create a database to search for
a keyword interactively.&nbsp; To create and use the documentation search
function, you must have the program glimpse 4.1 installed.&nbsp; Preset
are the options to index the given KDE-library documentation as well as
the Qt-documentation, assuming the path to the documentation files were
set in the "Documentation Path" dialog of the options- menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, the index can include directories the user can set up himself
by the "additional directories to index"-field.&nbsp; After setting a path
to an addional directory, the "Add" - button must be pushed to set the
path.&nbsp; A path once set can be removed from the index by selecting
the path in the path field and pushing "Remove".
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the user is offered three different
modes for the index size: tiny, small and medium.&nbsp; The higher the
index size, the more the index files will grow. On the other hand, a search
in a bigger searchdatabase will be faster and more successful, so we suggest
choosing a "medium" size.
<br>For using the search function, see section&nbsp; <a href="index-4.html#ss4.8">4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;
