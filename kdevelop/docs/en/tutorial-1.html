<P>As for the first version of this programming handbook, I don't make any promises about correctness and actuality towards special
programming aspects. It should be taken as a hint for programmers how to use KDevelop at it's best for development as well as for the
first time give a better introduction into certain things like API-documentation and the code frame structure of KAppWizard generated
projects. A lot of users requested a tutorial, especially for KDE application development. Mainly new developers have to get a good
structured guideline towards programming as the KDevelop handbook keeps only track of how to actually use the IDE. Advanced users shouldn't
have any problems as we tried to keep our design as usable as possible (at least how we thought it should look like).
This handbook tries to cover as much as is needed to know for a first start. The structure is therefore based on the actual difficulty
of programming C++ applications, so first come terminal applications and libraries (although still not supported by kdevelop), then GUI-based
programming starting with Qt-only programs, followed by KDE application development. Nevertheless most users will tend to develop KDE-apps, I
advise reading the Qt-section as a must, because this section will cover most Qt-related things that either have the same importance and use
within KDE-applications or are base-knowledge for GUI-development.
The KDE-section will then cope with example programs showing development steps and KDE-specific information like development standards and
special classes provided with the KDE-libraries.
To those that wish to take part in the newest issues of programming, I will at least try to explain CORBA and especially the IDL scripting
language to give a first understanding of internals that are needed for KOM/KOffice development.
The handbook ends with an introduction into that most interesting part of current KDE development, giving an overview of how to create a new
KOM/KOffice compliant KDE application and how the generated code structure works.
