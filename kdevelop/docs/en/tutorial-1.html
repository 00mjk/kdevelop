<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P>As Unix Systems are becoming more and more popular to even beginners working with computer machines due to its advantages in regards of
stability and functionality, most are somehow disappointed, because those applications don't have a consistant look and each one
behaves different from another. With KDE, developers have an almost perfect way to create first-class applications for Unix desktop
systems to get a wider user community by the mere quality their applications have to offer. Therefore, KDE becomes more and more
popular as a base for programming design, and developers want to take advantage of the possibilities that the system has to offer.

<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What you should know already</A>
</H3>

<P>For making the best use of this programming handbook, we assume that you already know how to program applications with the C++
programming language. You don't have to know anything about GUI programming, although having a basic knowledge will make things easier
to understand. Also, you should have made yourself comfortable with KDevelop by reading the <EM>The User Manual to KDevelop</EM>,
describing all commands and available functions that are provided by the IDE.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 About this Handbook</A>
</H3>

<P>This handbook has been written to give developers an introduction into KDE application development with special regards to the KDevelop
Integrated Development Environment. The reader will learn how to create his own application, what the framework automatically generated
by the KAppWizard already offers and how it runs. By the following chapters, the user is introduced into certain aspects of GUI
application design by a tutorial application, which we called <EM>KScribble</EM>.
<P><B>In the next chapter</B>
<P>we'll take a look at the Qt and KDE libraries, showing basic concepts and why things are the way they are.
Also, we will discuss how to create the tutorial applications provided with the Qt toolkit by using KDevelop, so beginners can already
see first results with a few steps, and thereby will learn how to make use of some of KDevelop's best features.
<P><B>In the following chapters</B> you will learn:
<UL>
<LI>how to create an application with the KAppWizard,</LI>
<LI>what the project skelleton already provides,</LI>
<LI>what the code already created means,</LI>
<LI>how to create your own views,</LI>
<LI>how to extend your application's functionality by dialog, menubars and toolbars</LI>
<LI>how to make your application user friendly by providing help functions and</LI>
<LI>how to write SGML online documentation.</LI>

<H3><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Additional Information</A>
</H3>

<P>Additional information about Qt/KDE programming is available by various sources:

<UL>
<LI><EM>Programming with Qt</EM> by Matthias Kalle Dalheimer, published by O'Reilly (see 
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com">http://www.oreilly.com</A>, covering almost all aspects of the Qt GUI toolkit and contains examples as well.</LI>
<LI><EM>The User Manual to KDevelop</EM>, provided with the KDevelop IDE,</LI>
<LI><EM>Online-Reference</EM> to the Qt-library, provided with your copy of the Qt toolkit in HTML and available as Postscript on
<A HREF="http://www.troll.no">http://www.troll.no</A></LI>
<LI>On the internet, see

<P>Addtionally, you should look for help on the various mailinglists, whose adresses are available on the mentioned websites, and on the
usenet newsgroups dedicated to users of KDE and Unix Systems.
<P>For KDevelop itself, you should send requests to our mailinglist at 
<A HREF="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de">kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de</A>. Mind that the KDevelop team is dedicated to provide the means to enable you to program
applications and therefore is not intended as a technical support team in cases where the applications you're developing don't work due
to implementation errors. By this, we ask all users to take advantage of the mailinglist in any case you're running into problems with
the use of the IDE itself, reporting bugs and questions about features as well as giving comments about what can be improved.
