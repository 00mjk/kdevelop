<P>
<P>This handbook has been assembled to provide KDE developers the information they will need when porting their applications to KDE 2,
currently under development. KDE 2 is based on the Qt 2.x and KDE 1.1.x libraries, whereby the KDE libraries are ported to work with
the current Qt library. Further, the KDE libraries will introduce a component technology based on the MICO CORBA implementation which
is developed and tested with the KOffice suite.
<P>As KDE application developers not involved in implementing for the KDE core team will probably want to port their applications, they
will not only have to watch out for the changes in Qt, but also for KDE's improvements and additions. As KDE 1.x applications will not
only be binary incompatible but also sourcecode incompatible, we want to provide enough information that can be used by developers that
are using the currently stable KDE 1.x implementation for applications that are suitable for production use, so transitioning will be
made less complicated and further implementations in current projects can be reviewed for possible problems that will arise when
porting.
<P>Also the usual KDE developer does not have too much information about CORBA, not to speak of KOM. Therefore, this handbook tries to
give an insight where to get information and how the current implementation works in general. This will enable you to find out where
your applications can probably take advantage of distributed component technology where needed.
<P>I want to thank all authors that were willing to contribute their current documentation to this handbook and hope this collection will
be of good use to those who want to stay on the bleeding edge of KDE development.
