<A NAME="s1"></A>1. Introduction</H2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of the KDevelop-Project is to provide
an easy to use IDE (Intergrated Development Enviroment) for Unix/X11.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all try to do our best to reach this
working together hand in hand, thus achieving the best possible result
for a working development environment to run under KDE.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current features are:
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projectmanagement:
<BLOCKQUOTE>The projectfile keeps all information for your project files
like file properties (include or exclude from distribution) and projects
can be created and changed individually.
<BR>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Wizard (generate complete frameworks)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The KAppWizard generates a complete framework application which
is ready-to-run within seconds.&nbsp; The framework offers as many features&nbsp;
as possible but nevertheless keeps enough openness for adjustment to your
new applications specific needs.&nbsp; It offers you a flexible, easy to
use tool to make developing easy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four&nbsp; treeviews (classes, projectfiles,files,
documentation)
<BLOCKQUOTE>The treeviews allow to easily switch between source/headerfiles,
classes and documentation, manage your project files without using an external
filemanager.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
The Classview offers direct switching to functions in the implementation
files;</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The&nbsp; LFV shows your projectfiles in a group-depending view where you
also have the opportunity to generate new files as well as adding a new
group etc.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The RFV&nbsp; shows your project directory with all files stored there,
so you have direct access for change there as well as changing file properties
by right-button-menus</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The Documentation View shows all available documentation, which consists
mainly of QT and KDE-libs, KDevelop help and tutorials as well as project-dependent&nbsp;
documentation like manual and header documentation</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated editor (KEdit)
<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;We integrated KEdit to make use of the easy interface-
we know we have to replace this with a syntax-coloring editor in time (soon).&nbsp;
We also took two Tabs for editors so you can switch easiely between headers
and implementation files.&nbsp; Opening files is just easy by clicking
into one of the treeviews or by choosing one out of the buffers-menu.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated Unix-tools for development
<BLOCKQUOTE>We integrated a lot of features which we thought could be very
useful. Also during testing KDevelop we had new ideas on making routine
work simpler and so tried to implement those ideas as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To mention are kdoc, automake &amp; friends etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Integrated documentationbrowser
<BLOCKQUOTE>The documentationbrowser offers direct access to the current
documentation of QT, KDE libs, the KDevelop manual and tutorial.&nbsp;
After setting up the documentation's paths', you're ready to browse all
documentation you need for developing your application. We also implemented
a feature which we think is very useful for all developers, mainly those
who take snapshots to stay on the bleeding edge of KDE, and that is automatic
updating your KDE-libs documentation within KDevelop.&nbsp; Also there
is the possibility to create a search database for quick &amp; easy access
to functions and classes in the documentation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickhelp and Status messages
<BLOCKQUOTE>We also thought to change from Tooltips to Quickhelp messages
in most cases, especially where more explanation is needed like for compiler
options.
<BR>As we additionally created a macro system for statusbar help in generated
application frames, we took this into KDevelop additionally to give the
user feedback about what KDevelop is doing in the background. This is especially
useful for running make and other parallel processes like saving files.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
<A NAME="ss1.1"></A>1.1 Changes</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>We made many changes to the last version to provide a more
stable environment and easier workin environment. This starts with the
implementation of new features such as the documentation generator and
database search, Quickhelp and Statushelp and ends with bugfixes where
we found solutions for.&nbsp; For users who experimented with our last
version 0.1,&nbsp; we have the bad news that the project files are incompatible
with this new version and you might have a lot of work converting your
existing projects.&nbsp; Also we have the first documentation of KDevelop
helping beginners to set up the environment and start work immediately.
To use the full power of&nbsp; KDevelop we suggest reading the documentation
first to have an impression of the program's capabilities as well as a
guide to various options we offer.

<P>Planned features for the future are mostly the change to a syntax-coloring
editor to offer more flexibility and visually aided development.&nbsp;
Programming tutorials are at least included in the concept as we see many
users and programmers who want to develop looking for a guide to QT and
KDE.&nbsp; The tutorials included in the QT documentation should be a first
help as well as a study of a generated project frame as we tried to create
this as flexible as possible and contain all the routine work you usually
have to do when you start writing a new application.&nbsp; We will do minor
changes there where KDElibs offer new functions or where we see that other
implementations lead to a better frame application.&nbsp; A lot of KDevelop's
features are self-explanatory, but you should report understanding problems
in any case to the KDevelop team to offer even more support for this product
and change things where needed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
