<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P>As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for commercial
purpose. The most popular software project among thousands is Linux, and it's existance is a proof for the quality that non-cost products
can achieve. But inspite of the quality, end users still suffer under the cryptic use of almost any Unix-like systems; even the most
enthusiastic users seem to only accept such an Operating System besides their commercial products. A major attempt to make free software
even more competitive and to get commercial producers to port their applications to e.g. Linux, is in the first place to make usability
as easy as possible. The KDE project then tries to close this gap and besides the programs, the used libraries offer a perfect way to
extend the variety of available GUI-based software. Anyway- those programs are still waiting for authors to write them, and we think
that coding should be made as easy as possible. Programming Unix applications isn't easy by itself, and besides the compiler an author
needs a lot more; especially as free software is often made in the author's free time, it is also a question of how much I like not only
seeing the end-product work but how much I like my development environment. So, KDevelop wants to take another major step- making the
programmer's life easier and save time; on the other hand the products created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliablity and
functionality in the same development period.
<P>To fullfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment wraps a lot of functionality under one hood. From within the user
interface, you're managing:
<P>- all development tools to C++ programming like compiler, linker, automake and autoconf,
- the KAppWizard and the Class Generator, who are creating complete applications already containing basic GUI components and
help extending the generated project,
- the generation of online- and API-documentation for your project
- internationalization support for your application
- the graphical development of user interfaces with the build-in dialogeditor
- the debugging of your application by using KDebugger
- the starting of any other program you need by adding it to the "Tools"-menu.
<P>KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and helps you develop your project by offering many other features like
the integrated Help-system and file/classbrowsers.
<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 About this Handboook</A>
</H3>

<P>This user manual to the KDevelop IDE tries to give a complete overview of the functionality and describes the basic development process
in short.
Chapter 1, Installation, covers the sytem requirements, installation and setting up of the KDevelop IDE.
Chapter 2, Programs, tells you how programs are created with standard GNU development tools and how they are build.
Chapter 3, Developing with KDevelop, takes you on a short trip describing the main fuctionality of the environment.
Chapter 4, Overview, explains the menus and dialogs as well as keyboard shortcuts.
Chapter 5, Projects, describes the creation and maintaining of software projects.
Chapter 6, The Helpsystem, shows how to use the build-in documenation browser and additional help functions.
Chapter 7, The Editor, tells you the features of file management and editing functionality of KDevelop.
Chapter 8, The Dialogeditor, features the integrated visual GUI constructor and how it generates C++ output.
Chapter 9, Questions and Answers, covers questions that regard the usage of KDevelop under different Unices and problems in general.
<H3><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Changes</A>
</H3>

<P>We made many changes to the last version to provide a more stable and easier working environment. This affects a completly reviewed helpsystem which
provides you help nearly everywhere. The projectmanagement has been developed to a very user-friendly way and does all of the configuration work by dialogs.
Printing support for a2ps and enscipt has been added as well as a documentation generator, now cross-referencing all libraries as well as cross-referencing
the API-documentation of projects. The documentation browser has been made configurable and supports searching and copying with right-button menus just
like the editing windows. Additionally, an individual search is provided by a search dialog for the documentation. Search results beyond the first result
of the documentation page can be displayed with the F3 key as well. The make-command is made configurable as well as autosaving is implemented and can be set
to different times or turned off. Further, the windows of KDevelop will turn on and off automatically if autoswitch is enabled in the KDevelop setup dialog.
Shortcuts are also configurable by a key-chooser dialog in the setup now. Additionally, we created a "Tip of the Day" dialog for short information each time
KDevlelop is started, as well as a startup screen shows that KDevelop is loading. Further, we added a brand-new installation utility that configures KDevelop
automatically according to your system, so no more additional configuration work has to be done when KDevelop is started the first time. If you had a previous
version of KDevelop installed, we recommend deleting your user's kdeveloprc file as well as the system kdeveloprc file to enable the new geometry management.
For users who experimented with our last version 0.1, we have the bad news that the project files are incompatible with this new version and you have to convert
your existing projects. We don't plan to change the project file system more than necessary and avoid incompatibility in the future, so creating a new application
will be woth the work. Also this documentation has been reviewed from that of version 0.2 and has been extended to the actual state of KDevelop.

<H3><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 The Future of KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Since we got KDevelop under the CVS system, development continues with a lot higher speed, which also will effect release dates.
We know a lot of interested programmers who at least tried version 0.1 and 0.2 of KDevelop, but most said "It's useful but not useful
enough to use it...". By version 0.3, we think we fullfillled most wishes towards stability and features and KDevelop provides the
functionality you need. In order to extend KDevelop beyond it's current features, we'd like you to send us bug reports and ideas for
more features to integrate. A most-lacking feature is an integrated dialog editor and we ourselves miss this feature a lot. For future
releases it is planned to offer a program module to let you create true KDE/ Qt dialogs visually as geometry measurements for dialogs are
one main problem for creating KDE dialogs at the moment. Until then we suggest using Qt-Architect / dlgedit, shipping with most distributions
and can also be found on the Internet. Furthermore, CORBA is the word of today's KDE development- without a doubt it will be the future of
KDE and applications developed for the GUI. Our goal for this release was to provide a most stable IDE, offering the needed features to
develop a KDE application in the way it is suggested for KDE 1.1. For future releases, we're planning to switch to the CORBA architecture
ourselves and as well integrate a frame application already providing a CORBA interface.
