<P>
<P>For programming beginners Unix systems seems like a threat as you have to get comfortable with the standard Unix-development
tools like the compilers, makefiles, automake and autoconf. Additionally, a GUI- what a mass of information to learn and
understand. Getting used to the programming languages C and C++ alone is work enough for a lot of computer enthusiasts to loose
interest in computing software. So most of those who are still willing to develop a useful application have to endure the lack
of an easy-to-use development environment, thus wasting a lot of time creating single files with editors, writing simple Makefiles
and quarreling with browsers to get access to library documentation, searching header files for functions and classes they want to
use- if you get that far.
The K Desktop Environment makes things a lot easier for users as well as for programmers, but doesn't solve all problems. You
can create a KDE-libs documentation with kdoc, but this is it. Some example programs provided with the kdesdk , giving you a short
overview about how you may start developing a KDE application, some frame-application generators do the basic work. But what is
beyond that ? You're still confronted with the problems mentioned above.
<P>
<P>Why KDevelop ?
<P>Suffering the basic programming problems ourselves, but still willing to develop Unix-applications under the GPL, the KDevelop
Team joined together to overcome most if not all of these. We don't say that KDevelop is the only solution to non-commercial
Unix/ X11 development, but at the moment we offer a very useful IDE for programming, offering a lot of really helpful features
which makes you concentrate on the real work, implementation.
<P>
<P>The KDevelop Philosophy
<P>Basically, we intended to provide an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the KDE look'n feel to develop KDE applications.
By Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we increased the IDE's stability and features far beyond that. Development is fun, but only if those
things that go wrong went wrong because of programming errors, not by the IDE you're using. Selfexplaining, we included many features
and fixed some misbehavoir that was present in the previous versions.&nbsp; Now with KDevelop you're able to create KDE, Qt and C++
applications with; a standard framework. We think that this meets the expectations that developers set into a good working IDE and
we'll try to expand the possibilities even further in future versions.
<P>
<P>Plans for the future
<P>Since we got KDevelop under the CVS system, development continues with a lot higher speed, which also will effect release dates.
We know a lot of interested programmers who at least tried version 0.1 and 0.2 of KDevelop, but most said "It's useful but not useful
enough to use it...". By version 0.3, we think we fullfillled most wishes towards stability and features and KDevelop provides the
functionality you need. In order to extend KDevelop beyond it's current features, we'd like you to send us bug reports and ideas for
more features to integrate. A most-lacking feature is an integrated dialog editor and we ourselves miss this feature a lot. For future
releases it is planned to offer a program module to let you create true KDE/ Qt dialogs visually as geometry measurements for dialogs are
one main problem for creating KDE dialogs at the moment. Until then we suggest using Qt-Architect / dlgedit, shipping with most distributions
and can also be found on the Internet. Furthermore, CORBA is the word of today's KDE development- without a doubt it will be the future of
KDE and applications developed for the GUI. Our goal for this release was to provide a most stable IDE, offering the needed features to
develop a KDE application in the way it is suggested for KDE 1.1. For future releases, we're planning to switch to the CORBA architecture
ourselves and as well integrate a frame application already providing a CORBA interface.
<P>
<P>What does the KDevelop IDE offer a programmer ?
<P>
<P>Creating Applications:
<P>With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard generates three
kinds of fram applications, as:
<P>-a single document interface (SDI) KDE-application including a menubar, a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control resource management
to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE 1.1 application. The application frame also contains statusbar help messages as
known from commercial products just like KDevelop itself. From the programmer's point of view, it is based on three application-specific
classes leaning on the MVC-concept (Model-View-Controller). Technically, the base classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction
is at least created most logical to create applications with a GUI.
<P>-a KDE-based application frame window. This application type offers most flexibility to those wanting to develop their program from scratch,
but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.
<P>-a Qt-only based program framework. For those programmers who want to use the Qt library as the GUI interface alone, we tried to offer you
a smart framework to support your application development. As Qt programming is fully supported, you should have no problems to create a
full-functional application by using Qt only.
<P>-a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting
to write a terminal based C++ program. Just remove the "Hello World" line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as
for KDE applications.
<P>For importing existing applications, we suggest using the New Project option. Select "Project" from the menubar and select
"New". The New Project dialog offers creates a project directory and subdirectories as well as the project file with the project name and
type. We advise copying all needed creation files like configure.in, Makefile.am's etc. into the project directory from your existing project
and choose "Project"->"Add file(s)"->"Add existing file(s)" to copy the sources into your new project directory. Note that your Makefile.am's
will be changed by KDevelop and you probably will have to change or delete some entries to provide clean compilation. You should not edit the
KDevelop write area, instead you should read the entries made by KDevelop and delete matching titles created yourself. Also note that only
one project is supported to work on at the moment, so your source files should be in the project's subdirectory which has the same name as
the main project directory. In the Logical File Viewer the groups have to be set by yourself if you chose to use that importing possibility.
<P>Another way could be to create a frame application and delete the created source and header files. Then you can add existing files as above.
<P>
<P>Creating Libraries:
<P>This type of project isn't supported at the moment. This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions of KDevelop.
<P>
<P>Projectmanagement:
<P>KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful not to delete it.
It is stored in the project's base directory and has to be opened to load the project. The projectfile keeps all information for your files
like the file properties, install path, distribution status and compiler options (CXXFLAGS). Setting file properties allows you to keep track
of where the files should go.
<P>
<P>Visual working interface:
<P>The KDevelop main working interface is separated in three main windows: the main working field on the upper right, the treeviews on the upper left
and the outputview on the bottom of the main window. Around that are the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar.Except the menubar, each item can be
turned on and off to give you a flexible environment.
<P>
<P>Main working window:
<P>The main window consists of four tabs for which the first two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource window
for headerfiles and any other files, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are followed by the Documentation window displaying all documentation
in HTML-format. At last is the Tools window for the Tools integrated. The Tools are external programs like KIconedit and KDbg and will be displayed
there. Functionality for joining these Tools with the filenames to be edited will be integrated in time.
<P>Since we changed the editor from KEdit to KWrite, a lot of functionality was added to KDevelop, such as configurable syntax-highlighting,
font sizes and colored display. We hope all those who preferred other editors for writing their code are now willing to change to KDevelop completely.
<P>Treeview:
The treeview offers you direct access to all sections of your program files. Therefore, we inserted four treeviews for different needs, as are:
<P>- the Classviewer (CV):                                      shows the project, classes, methods and variables as well as structs and templates. Clicking on items on the tree
will switch to the selected class, method or variable in the editing windows.
<P>- the Logical File Viewer (LFV):     shows the project files in logical groups, such as a header file group, a sourcefile group etc. This is configurable,
so you can add your own groups there.
<P>- the Real File Viewer (RFV):                shows the project directory tree in a filemanager-style and offers direct filemanagement.
<P>- the Documentation tree (DOC):      shows the documentation as books. It is configurable in the "Others" section, where you can add additional documentation
by a right button menu.
<P>Output window:
The Output window is separated as well into a messages window, a stdin/stdout window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<P>- messages window:   displays all output of the compiler. Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the cursor to the line the compiler found an error.
- stdin/stdout window: display for terminal based applications you're developing. Running such an application will open the window and allow you interaction like
starting it in kvt or other consoles.
- stderr window: displays all the error messages your program produces. This is useful for testing purposes.
<P>The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process is called, such as make or a terminal application.
<P>Quickhelp, Status messages, "What's this ?"
<P>For Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we integrated an extending statusbar message system, displaying statushelp for menubar entries and process status for
each selected function. The statusbar always shows you what KDevelop is doing. Furthermore, the statusbar shows the mode of the insert / overwrite
key as well as displaying line and comlumn position of the cursor in the editwindow. Dialog fields offer quickhelp by right mouse button click
so you don't have to worry about searching functions in the documentation. Also, the "What's this ?" button on the far right of the toolbar offers help
window for the main working view. Just push the "What's this ?" button and click on the item you want to have a descriptive help for.

<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Changes</A>
</H3>

<P>We made many changes to the last version to provide a more stable and easier working environment. This affects a completly reviewed helpsystem which
provides you help nearly everywhere. The projectmanagement has been developed to a very user-friendly way and does all of the configuration work by dialogs.
Printing support for a2ps and enscipt has been added as well as a documentation generator, now cross-referencing all libraries as well as cross-referencing
the API-documentation of projects. The documentation browser has been made configurable and supports searching and copying with right-button menus just
like the editing windows. Additionally, an individual search is provided by a search dialog for the documentation. Search results beyond the first result
of the documentation page can be displayed with the F3 key as well. The make-command is made configurable as well as autosaving is implemented and can be set
to different times or turned off. Further, the windows of KDevelop will turn on and off automatically if autoswitch is enabled in the KDevelop setup dialog.
Shortcuts are also configurable by a key-chooser dialog in the setup now. Additionally, we created a "Tip of the Day" dialog for short information each time
KDevlelop is started, as well as a startup screen shows that KDevelop is loading. Further, we added a brand-new installation utility that configures KDevelop
automatically according to your system, so no more additional configuration work has to be done when KDevelop is started the first time. If you had a previous
version of KDevelop installed, we recommend deleting your user's kdeveloprc file as well as the system kdeveloprc file to enable the new geometry management.
For users who experimented with our last version 0.1, we have the bad news that the project files are incompatible with this new version and you have to convert
your existing projects. We don't plan to change the project file system more than necessary and avoid incompatibility in the future, so creating a new application
will be woth the work. Also this documentation has been reviewed from that of version 0.2 and has been extended to the actual state of KDevelop.
