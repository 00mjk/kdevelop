<a NAME="s1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For programming beginners Unix systems seem
like a threat as you have to get comfortable with the standard Unix-development
tools like the compilers, makefiles, automake and autoconf.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, a GUI- what a mass of information to learn and understand.
Getting used to the programming languages C and C++ alone is work enough
for a lot of computer enthusiasts to loose interest in computing software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So most of those who are still willing to develop a useful application
have to endure the lack of an easy-to-use development environment, thus
wasting a lot of time creating single files with editors, writing simple
Makefiles and quarreling with browsers to get access to library documentation,
searching header files for functions and classes they want to use- if you
get that far.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The K Desktop Environment makes things a lot easier
for users as well as for programmers, but doesn't solve all problems.&nbsp;
You can create a KDE-libs documentation with kdoc, but this is it. Some
example programs provided with the kdesdk , giving you&nbsp; a short overview
about how you may start developing a KDE application, some frame-application
generators do the basic work. But what is beyond that ?&nbsp; You're still
confronted with the problems mentioned above.
<p><b><u>Why KDevlop ?</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffering the basic programming problems ourselves,
but still willing to develop Unix-applications under the GPL, the KDevelop
Team joined together to overcome most if not all of these.&nbsp; We don't
say that KDevelop is the only solution to non-commercial Unix/ X11 development,
but at the moment we offer a useful IDE for programming.&nbsp; We ourselves
are developing our project with KDevelop, wich is very complex and so developing
without KDevelop's features would waste a lot of our time and lets us create
new ideas for an IDE as well as finding bugs.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>The KDevelop Philosophy</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we intended to provide an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) with a KDE look'n feel to make developing KDE
applications as easy as possible for programmers. Meanwhile, other IDE's
are in work which intend to be more flexible with developing applications
for Unix/X11 in general.&nbsp; As much as we like all KDE programmers use
KDevelop to create their applications,&nbsp; we don't want to keep other
out of using it.&nbsp; By Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we increased the IDE's
stability and features.&nbsp; We don't claim to be the best solution ever
invented for development, but at least we seem to offer the best solution
possible at the moment. So we'd like all programmers to try KDevelop for
developing their own applications.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Plans for the future</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we got KDevelop under the CVS system, development
continues with a lot higher speed, which also will effect release dates.&nbsp;
We know a lot of interested programmers who at least tried version 0.1
and 0.2 of KDevelop, but most said "It's useful but not useful enough to
use it...".&nbsp; By version 0.3, we think we fullfillled most wishes towards
stability and features, at least to give it a try.&nbsp; In order to extend
KDevelop beyond it's current features, we'd like you to send us bug reports
and ideas for more features to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp; A most-lacking feature
is an integrated dialog editor and we ourselves miss this feature a lot.&nbsp;
For future releases it is planned to offer a program module to let you
create true KDE/ Qt dialogs visually as geometry measurements for dialogs
are one main problem for creating KDE dialogs at the moment.&nbsp; Until
then we suggest using Qt-Architect / dlgedit, shipping with most distributions
and can also be found on the Internet.&nbsp; Furthermore, CORBA is the
word of today's KDE development- without a doubt it will be the future
of KDE and applications developed for the GUI.&nbsp; Our goal for this
release was to provide a most stable IDE, offering the needed features
to develop a KDE application in the way it is suggested for KDE 1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For future releases, we're planning to switch to the CORBA architecture
ourselves and as well integrate a frame application already providing a
CORBA&nbsp;interface.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>What does the KDevelop IDE offer a programmer ?</u></b>
<p><b>Creating Applications:</b>
<p>With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according
to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard generates three
kinds of fram applications, as:
<blockquote>
<li>
&nbsp;a single document interface (SDI) KDE-application including a menubar,
a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control resource management
to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE 1.1 application.&nbsp;
The application frame also contains statusbar help messages as known from
commercial products just like KDevelop itself.&nbsp; From the programmer's
point of view, it is based on three application-specific classes leaning
on the MVC-concept&nbsp; (Model-View-Controller).&nbsp; Technically, the
base classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least
created most logical to create applications with a GUI.&nbsp; See&nbsp;
section&nbsp; <a href="index-4.html#ss4.3">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp; New Projects
with KAppWizard .</a></li>

<li>
a KDE-based application frame window.&nbsp; This application type offers
most flexibility to those wanting to develop their program from scratch,
but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.</li>

<li>
a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting
to write a terminal based C++ program.&nbsp; Just remove the "Hello World"
line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as
for KDE applications.</li>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For importing existing applications, we plan to set
up a dialog allowing to take all Makefile.am's and selected source / header
and additional files and merge them to a KDevelop project type. Until then
we suggest creating a base framework with KAppWizard giving then name and
version of your program. Then delete the created sourcefiles and add additional
files to the project with Project->Add File(s) to Project...
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Creating Libraries:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of project isn't supported at the moment.
This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions
of KDevelop.
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<p><br><b>Projectmanagement:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj&nbsp;
ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful
not to delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has
to be opened to load the project.&nbsp; The projectfile keeps all information
for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status
and compiler options (CXXFLAGS).&nbsp; Setting file properties allows you
to keep track of where the files should go.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Visual working interface:</b>
<p>The KDevelop main working interface is separated in three main windows:
the main working field on the upper right, the treeviews on the upper left
and the outputview on the bottom of the main window.
<br>Around that are the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar.&nbsp; Except
the menubar, each item can be turned on and off to give you a flexible
environment.
<p><i><u>Main working window:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main window consists of four tabs for which the
first two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource window
for headerfiles and any other files, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes.
These are followed by the Documentation window displaying all documentation
in HTML-format.&nbsp; At last is the Tools window for the Tools integrated.
The Tools are external programs like KIconedit and KDbg and will be displayed
there.&nbsp; Functionality for joining these Tools with the filenames to
be edited will be integrated in time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we changed the editor from KEdit to KWrite,
a lot of functionality was added to KDevelop, such as configurable syntax-highlighting,
font sizes and colored display.&nbsp; We hope all those who preferred other
editors for&nbsp; writing their code are now willing to change to KDevelop
completely.
<p><i><u>Treeview:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treeview offers you direct access to all sections
of your program files. Therefore, we inserted four treeviews for different
needs, as are:
<br>- the Classviewer (CV):&nbsp; shows the project, classes, methods and
variables as well as structs and templates.&nbsp; Clicking on items on
the tree will switch to the selected class, method or variable in the editing
windows.
<br>- the Logical File Viewer (LFV):&nbsp; shows the project files in logical
groups, such as a header file group, a sourcefile group etc.&nbsp; This
is configurable, so you can add your own groups there.
<br>- the Real File Viewer (RFV):&nbsp; shows the project directory tree
in a filemanager-style and offers direct filemanagement.
<p><i><u>Output window:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Output window is separated as well into a messages
window, a stdin/stdout window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<br>- messages window:&nbsp; displays all output of the compiler.&nbsp;
Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the cursor
to the line the compiler found an error.
<br>- stdin/stdout window:&nbsp; display for terminal based applications
you're developing.&nbsp; Running such an application will open the window
and allow you interaction like starting it in kvt or other consoles.
<br>- stderr window:&nbsp; displays all the error messages your program
produces. this is useful for testing purposes.
<p>The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process
is called, such as make or a terminal application.
<p><i><u>Quickhelp and Status messages</u></i>
<p>For Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we integrated an extending statusbar message
system, displaying statushelp for menubar entries and process status for
each selected function. The statusbar always shows you what KDevelop is
doing. Furthermore, the statusbar shows the mode of the insert / overwrite
key as well as displaying line and comlumn position of the cursor in the
editwindow.&nbsp; Dialog fields offer quickhelp by right mouse button click
so you don't have to worry about searching functions in the documentation.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss1.1"></a>1.1 Changes</h2>

<blockquote>We made many changes to the last version to provide a more
stable and easier working environment. This starts with the implementation
of new features such as the documentation generator and database search,
Quickhelp and Statushelp and ends with bugfixes where we found solutions
for.&nbsp; Other things are extended options dialogs to configure KDevelop
to your sytem as well as project-related dialogs like the class generator.
The internal geometry has been reviewed and fixed for various effects and
now offers you most of what you could expect.&nbsp; If you had a previous
version of KDevelop installed, we recommend deleting your user's kdeveloprc
file as well as the system kdeveloprc file to enable the new geometry management.&nbsp;
For users who experimented with our last version 0.1, we have the bad news
that the project files are incompatible with this new version and you have
to convert your existing projects.&nbsp; We don't plan to change the project
file system more than necessary and avoid incompatibility in the future,
so creating a new application will be woth the work.&nbsp; Also this documentation
has been reviewed from that of version 0.2 and has been extended to the
actual state of KDevelop.</blockquote>
