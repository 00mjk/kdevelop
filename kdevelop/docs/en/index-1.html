<a NAME="s1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For programming beginners Unix systems seem
like a threat as you have to get comfortable with the standard Unix-development
tools like the compilers, makefiles, automake and autoconf.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally, a GUI- what a mass of information to learn and understand.
Getting used to the programming languages C and C++ alone is work enough
for a lot of computer enthusiasts to loose interest in computing software.&nbsp;&nbsp;
So most of those who are still willing to develop a useful application
have to endure the lack of an easy-to-use development environment, thus
wasting a lot of time creating single files with editors, writing simple
Makefiles and quarreling with browsers to get access to library documentation,
searching header files for functions and classes they want to use- if you
get that far.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The K Desktop Environment makes things a lot easier
for users as well as for programmers, but doesn't solve all problems.&nbsp;
You can create a KDE-libs documentation with kdoc, but this is it. Some
example programs provided with the kdesdk , giving you&nbsp; a short overview
about how you may start developing a KDE application, some frame-application
generators do the basic work. But what is beyond that ?&nbsp; You're still
confronted with the problems mentioned above.
<p><b><u>Why KDevelop ?</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffering the basic programming problems ourselves,
but still willing to develop Unix-applications under the GPL, the KDevelop
Team joined together to overcome most if not all of these.&nbsp; We don't
say that KDevelop is the only solution to non-commercial Unix/ X11 development,
but at the moment we offer a very useful IDE for programming , offering
a lot of really helpful features which makes you concentrate on the real
work, implementation.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>The KDevelop Philosophy</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, we intended to provide an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) with the KDE look'n feel to develop KDE applications.&nbsp;
By Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we increased the IDE's stability and features
far beyond that. Development is fun, but only if those things that go wrong
went wrong because of programming errors, not by the IDE you're using.&nbsp;
Selfexplaining, we included many features and fixed some misbehavoir that
was present in the previous versions.&nbsp; Now with KDevelop you're able
to create KDE, Qt and C++ applications with&nbsp; a standard framework.&nbsp;
We think that this meets the expectations that developers set into a good
working IDE and we'll try to expand the possibilities even further in future
versions.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Plans for the future</u></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we got KDevelop under the CVS system, development
continues with a lot higher speed, which also will effect release dates.&nbsp;
We know a lot of interested programmers who at least tried version 0.1
and 0.2 of KDevelop, but most said "It's useful but not useful enough to
use it...".&nbsp; By version 0.3, we think we fullfillled most wishes towards
stability and features and KDevelop provides the functionality you need.&nbsp;
In order to extend KDevelop beyond it's current features, we'd like you
to send us bug reports and ideas for more features to integrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A most-lacking feature is an integrated dialog editor and we ourselves
miss this feature a lot.&nbsp; For future releases it is planned to offer
a program module to let you create true KDE/ Qt dialogs visually as geometry
measurements for dialogs are one main problem for creating KDE dialogs
at the moment.&nbsp; Until then we suggest using Qt-Architect / dlgedit,
shipping with most distributions and can also be found on the Internet.&nbsp;
Furthermore, CORBA is the word of today's KDE development- without a doubt
it will be the future of KDE and applications developed for the GUI.&nbsp;
Our goal for this release was to provide a most stable IDE, offering the
needed features to develop a KDE application in the way it is suggested
for KDE 1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; For future releases, we're planning to switch
to the CORBA architecture ourselves and as well integrate a frame application
already providing a CORBA interface.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>What does the KDevelop IDE offer a programmer ?</u></b>
<p><b>Creating Applications:</b>
<p>With KAppWizard, you can create a new application project according
to your choice of application type. For now, KAppWizard generates three
kinds of fram applications, as:
<blockquote>
<li>
&nbsp;a single document interface (SDI) KDE-application including a menubar,
a toolbar and a statusbar. It contains basic control resource management
to allow extending the frame application into a unique KDE 1.1 application.&nbsp;
The application frame also contains statusbar help messages as known from
commercial products just like KDevelop itself.&nbsp; From the programmer's
point of view, it is based on three application-specific classes leaning
on the MVC-concept&nbsp; (Model-View-Controller).&nbsp; Technically, the
base classes may not be viewed that way, but it's construction is at least
created most logical to create applications with a GUI.&nbsp; See&nbsp;
section&nbsp; <a href="index-4.html#ss4.3">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp; New Projects
with KAppWizard .</a></li>

<li>
a KDE-based application frame window.&nbsp; This application type offers
most flexibility to those wanting to develop their program from scratch,
but can also be used as a basis for developing wizard applications or modules.</li>

<li>
a Qt-only based program framework.&nbsp; For those programmers who want
to use the Qt library as the GUI interface alone, we tried to offer you
a smart framework to support your application development.&nbsp; As Qt
programming is fully supported, you should have no problems to create a
full-functional application by using Qt only.</li>

<li>
a C++ program framework. This application type is intended for those wanting
to write a terminal based C++ program.&nbsp; Just remove the "Hello World"
line in main() and construct your classes the same way with KDevelop as
for KDE applications.</li>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For importing existing applications, we suggest using
the New Project option.&nbsp; Select "Project" from the menubar and select
"New".&nbsp; The New Project dialog offers creates a project directory
and subdirectories as well as the project file with the project name and
type.&nbsp;&nbsp; We advise copying all needed creation files like configure.in,
Makefile.am's etc. into the project directory from your existing project
and choose "Project"->"Add file(s)"->"Add existing file(s)"&nbsp; to copy
the sources into your new project directory.&nbsp; Note that your Makefile.am's
will be changed by KDevelop and you probably will have to change or delete
some entries to provide clean compilation.&nbsp; You should not edit the
KDevelop write area, instead you should read the entries made by KDevelop
and delete matching titles created yourself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note that only one project is supported to
work on at the moment, so your source files should be in the project's
subdirectory which has the same name as the main project directory.&nbsp;
In the Logical File Viewer the groups have to be set by yourself if you
chose to use that importing possibility.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way could be to create a frame application
and delete the created source and header files.&nbsp; Then you can add
existing files as above.
<p><b>Creating Libraries:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This type of project isn't supported at the moment.
This will be another feature planned to be integrated in later versions
of KDevelop.
<p><b>Projectmanagement:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KDevelop creates a projectfile with the .kdevprj&nbsp;
ending. This file contains all your project information, so be careful
not to delete it. It is stored in the project's base directory and has
to be opened to load the project.&nbsp; The projectfile keeps all information
for your files like the file properties, install path, distribution status
and compiler options (CXXFLAGS).&nbsp; Setting file properties allows you
to keep track of where the files should go.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Visual working interface:</b>
<p>The KDevelop main working interface is separated in three main windows:
the main working field on the upper right, the treeviews on the upper left
and the outputview on the bottom of the main window.
<br>Around that are the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar.&nbsp; Except
the menubar, each item can be turned on and off to give you a flexible
environment.
<p><i><u>Main working window:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main window consists of four tabs for which the
first two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource window
for headerfiles and any other files, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes.
These are followed by the Documentation window displaying all documentation
in HTML-format.&nbsp; At last is the Tools window for the Tools integrated.
The Tools are external programs like KIconedit and KDbg and will be displayed
there.&nbsp; Functionality for joining these Tools with the filenames to
be edited will be integrated in time.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we changed the editor from KEdit to KWrite,
a lot of functionality was added to KDevelop, such as configurable syntax-highlighting,
font sizes and colored display.&nbsp; We hope all those who preferred other
editors for&nbsp; writing their code are now willing to change to KDevelop
completely.
<p><i><u>Treeview:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treeview offers you direct access to all sections
of your program files. Therefore, we inserted four treeviews for different
needs, as are:
<br>- the Classviewer (CV):&nbsp; shows the project, classes, methods and
variables as well as structs and templates.&nbsp; Clicking on items on
the tree will switch to the selected class, method or variable in the editing
windows.
<br>- the Logical File Viewer (LFV):&nbsp; shows the project files in logical
groups, such as a header file group, a sourcefile group etc.&nbsp; This
is configurable, so you can add your own groups there.
<br>- the Real File Viewer (RFV):&nbsp; shows the project directory tree
in a filemanager-style and offers direct filemanagement.
<br>- the Documentation tree&nbsp;(DOC):&nbsp; shows the documentation
as books.&nbsp; It is configurable in the "Others" section, where you can
add additional documentation by a right button menu.
<p><i><u>Output window:</u></i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Output window is separated as well into a messages
window, a stdin/stdout window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<br>- messages window:&nbsp; displays all output of the compiler.&nbsp;
Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the cursor
to the line the compiler found an error.
<br>- stdin/stdout window:&nbsp; display for terminal based applications
you're developing.&nbsp; Running such an application will open the window
and allow you interaction like starting it in kvt or other consoles.
<br>- stderr window:&nbsp; displays all the error messages your program
produces. this is useful for testing purposes.
<p>The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process
is called, such as make or a terminal application.
<p><i><u>Quickhelp, Status messages, "What's this ?"</u></i>
<p>For Version 0.3 of KDevelop, we integrated an extending statusbar message
system, displaying statushelp for menubar entries and process status for
each selected function. The statusbar always shows you what KDevelop is
doing. Furthermore, the statusbar shows the mode of the insert / overwrite
key as well as displaying line and comlumn position of the cursor in the
editwindow.&nbsp; Dialog fields offer quickhelp by right mouse button click
so you don't have to worry about searching functions in the documentation.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the "What's this&nbsp;?" button on the far
right of the toolbar offers help window for the main working view.&nbsp;
Just push the "What's this ?" button and click on the item you want to
have a descriptive help for.
<br>&nbsp;

<a NAME="ss1.1"></a>1.1 Changes</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We made many changes to the last version
to provide a more stable and easier working environment. This affects a
completly reviewed helpsystem which provides you help nearly everywhere.&nbsp;
The projectmanagement has been developed to a very user-friendly way and
does all of the configuration work by dialogs. Printing support for a2ps
and enscipt has been added as well as a documentation generator, now cross-referencing
all libraries as well as cross-referencing the API-documentation of projects.&nbsp;
The documentation browser has been made configurable and supports searching
and copying with right-button menus just like the editing windows.&nbsp;
Additionally, an individual search is provided by a search dialog for the
documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The make-command is made configurable as well
as autosaving is implemented and can be set to different times or turned
off.&nbsp; Further, the windows of KDevelop will turn on and off automatically
if autoswitch is enabled in the KDevelop setup dialog.&nbsp; Shortcuts
are also configurable by a key-chooser dialog in the setup now.
<p>If you had a previous version of KDevelop installed, we recommend deleting
your user's kdeveloprc file as well as the system kdeveloprc file to enable
the new geometry management.&nbsp; For users who experimented with our
last version 0.1, we have the bad news that the project files are incompatible
with this new version and you have to convert your existing projects.&nbsp;
We don't plan to change the project file system more than necessary and
avoid incompatibility in the future,
so creating a new application will
be woth the work.&nbsp; Also this documentation has been reviewed from
that of version 0.2 and has been extended to the actual state of KDevelop.</blockquote>
