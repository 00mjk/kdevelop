<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P>As everything on earth has it's fashions, today's computer world seems to tend more to the use of free software even for
commercial purpose. The most popular software project among thousands is Linux, and it's existance is a proof for the quality that
non-cost products can achieve. But inspite of the quality, end users still suffer under the cryptic use of almost any Unix-like
systems; even the most enthusiastic users seem to only accept such an Operating System besides their commercial products. A major
attempt to make free software even more competitive and to get commercial producers to port their applications to e.g. Linux, is
in the first place to make usability as easy as possible. The KDE project tries to close this gap and besides the programs
provided with it, the libraries offer a perfect way to extend the variety of available GUI-based software. But especially as free
software is often made in the author's free time, the question for authors is how much they like their development environment.
KDevelop wants to take another major step- making the programmer's life easier and save time; on the other hand the products
created with KDevelop can reach a higher level of reliablity and functionality in the same development period.
To fullfill this goal, the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment wraps a lot of functionality. From within the user
interface, you're managing:
<UL>
<LI> all development tools needed for C++ programming like compiler, linker, automake and autoconf,</LI>
<LI> the KAppWizard, who generates complete applications that are ready-to-run,</LI>
<LI> the Classgenerator, creating new classes and integrating them into the current project,</LI>
<LI> file properties for sources, headers, documentation etc. to be included in the project and their installation destination
for the end-user,</LI>
<LI> the creation of User-Handbooks written with SGML and automatic generation of HTML-output with the KDE-look'n feel,</LI>
<LI> automatic HTML-based API-documentation for your project's classes with cross-reference to the used libraries,</LI>
<LI> internationalization support for your application, allowing translators to easiely add their target language,</LI>
<LI> WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) -creation of user interfaces with the build-in dialogeditor,</LI>
<LI> the debugging of your application using KDbg,</LI>
<LI> the editing of project-specific pixmaps with KIconedit,</LI>
<LI> any other program you need for development by adding it to the "Tools"-menu.</LI>
</UL>

KDevelop makes it a joy to work with all programs in one place and helps saving time by automating standard development processes
as well as giving you direct, transparent access to all information you need. The integrated browsing mechanisms are designed to
support all type of requests that developers have in conjuction with their project. The classviewer brings you anywhere in the
project code by a mouseclick without needing to search for files or lines; file trees give direct access to the project files and
the integrated helpsystem offers the best availability to online-documentations anywhere within the IDE.

<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Changes</A>
</H3>

<P>This version of the KDevelop IDE is yet another huge step towards providing an easy to understand environment that fullfills it's
promise towards usability and functionality. Since the last release, we sat down to extend the design, set the goals and decided
about the technical realization. Then, the main work was done in three different areas: the classviewer, the dialogeditor and the
"look-n'-feel" in general, including new editing functions and the creation of KDE-applications. In order to do that,
we were proud to welcome the newest two team members, Jonas Nordin, who designed a full-featured classparser and -viewer, and
Pascal Krahmer, who joined the team to implement an up-to-date dialogeditor running inside KDevelop and interacting with the
project management. Other work was done in various parts of the IDE, such as a new <CODE>grep</CODE>-dialog allowing expression search
through all project files or even the whole system KDevelop runs on; extended configuration utilities; this reviewed and extended
documentation as well as a new project generator.

<H3><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 About this Handboook</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>This user manual to the KDevelop IDE gives the user a complete overview of the provided functionality and describes the basic
development process in short, which can be seen as an introduction into C++ application design with KDevelop in general. For more
information about specific programming issues, we advise to read the KDevelop Programming Handbook, covering themes like
understanding generated application frameworks and how to create full-featured KDE applications by example projects. The design of
this handbook is therefore separated into the following parts:
<P>Chapter 1, 
<A HREF="index-2.html#Installation">Installation</A>, covers the sytem requirements, installation and setting up of the
KDevelop IDE.
<P>Chapter 2, 
<A HREF="index-3.html#Programs">Programs</A>, tells you how programs are created with standard GNU development tools and
how they are build.
<P>Chapter 3, 
<A HREF="index-4.html#Overview">Overview</A>, explains the menus and dialogs as well as keyboard shortcuts.
<P>Chapter 4, 
<A HREF="index-5.html#Projects">Projects</A>, describes the creation and maintaining of software projects.
<P>Chapter 5, 
<A HREF="index-6.html#Developing with KDevelop">Developing with KDevelop</A>, takes you on a short trip describing the
main fuctionality of the environment.
<P>Chapter 6, 
<A HREF="index-7.html#The Helpsystem">The Helpsystem</A>, shows how to use the build-in documenation browser and
additional help functions.
<P>Chapter 7, 
<A HREF="index-8.html#The Editor">The Editor</A>, tells you the features of file management and editing functionality of
KDevelop.
<P>Chapter 8, 
<A HREF="index-9.html#The Dialogeditor">The Dialogeditor</A>, features the integrated visual GUI constructor and how it
generates C++ output.
<P>Chapter 9, 
<A HREF="index-10.html#Questions and Answers">Questions and Answers</A>, covers questions that regard to the usage of
KDevelop under different Unices and problem solutions in general.
<P>For programming beginners and new users of this product we recommend to read yourself into this manual before starting to actually
work with the IDE; for sure this will save you a lot of time searching for functions that you might miss at the first look and the
understanding of the usage seems to be the best start towards effective development of new applications.
