<h2>
<a NAME="s4"></a>4. Usage</h2>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you've followed section 3, <a href="index-3.html">Configuration,</a>
<br>&nbsp;KDevelop is set up for development.&nbsp; It is sufficient to
read the usage description to get most of the IDE's capabilities and to
know how to use the most needed functions available for creating applications
and extending them.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.1"></a>4.1&nbsp; General Usage</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Picture 4.1 you see the KDevelop main view with all
window elements enabled.&nbsp; Those are:
<p><b>- Menubar:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gives access to all functions available
<p><b>- Standard toolbar:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
invokes most needed functions for editing and development creation.
<p><b>- Statusbar:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
displays the status of processes running as well as a quickhelp function
for menuenties while those are highlighted.&nbsp; Also it shows the status
of the insert / overwrite mode for the editor and the position of the cursor
in the active editing window by line and column.
<p><b>- Treeview:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
contains four tabulators for different treeview functions.&nbsp; Those
are: CV for the classviewer; displaying the project (KTest), the project's
classes (KTesApp) and class members (e.g. KTestApp()).&nbsp; LFV stands
for "logical file viewer"; showing the project files in groups and giving
easier access to files by grouptype.&nbsp; The RFV ("real file viewer")
shows the project directory tree as it is in the system's directory tree.&nbsp;
The most right tabulator, DOC, gives access to the documentation tree,
making documentations available for the Documentation-Browser window.
<p>-<b> Editview:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
displays the working windows for development. Sourcefiles will be opened
in the "C/C++ Files" window, all other project-related files including
the headerfiles are connected to the "Header/Resource Files" window.&nbsp;
The Documentation-Browser window is intended to show this manual, tutorials,
library documentation and an index entries page after a search. Finally,
the "Tools" window allows embedding third-party programs like KDbg, KIconeditor
and KTranslator.
<p><b>- Outputview:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
contains three windows for cormpiler output,
<br>&nbsp;

<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.2"></a>4.2&nbsp; Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
All keyboard shortcuts can be configured in the keybindings dialog which
is located in the KDevelop Setup, accessed by the options menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note that standard key accelerators for e.g.&nbsp; "New" or "Print" are
configured by the KDE-Controll-Center, Configure Standard Keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "Default" button will reset all changes and individual keybinding configuration
to the default settings.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.3"></a>4.3&nbsp; New projects with KAppWizard</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of four different
types of projects, constructing a framework for each.&nbsp; All projects
are FSF-compliant and use the GNU standard development tools as described
in the requirements section of this handbook.
<p>For KDE applications, the wizard offers two different frameworks, the
KDE-Application, providing a complete application with base classes for
document type, view and application. This includes the creation of a menubar,
toolbar and statusbar, the mainwindow inherits theKTMainWindow class.
<br>The KDE-Mini-Application only gives a view which is empty. This type
of project can be used for the creation of small desktop tools or other
simple applications without too much change on the existing code provided
by the framework.
<p>A Qt-Application offers the creation of a Qt-only program if you wish
no dependencies towards the KDE-libraries for end-users. (NOTE: The configure
script still checks for the KDE-libraries.&nbsp; This will be fixed in
the next version of KDevelop) .&nbsp;&nbsp; The Qt-Application also is
created by using tree base classes like the KDE-standard-Application and
provides a menubar, toolbar and statusbar.
<p>The C++ -Application type offers a framework for creating commandline
applications.&nbsp; It is ready to run and by default displays "Hello World"
as the only action.&nbsp; This may be useful for C++ learners who would
like to program applications without using a GUI first or for those working
on commandline programs written in C++ or C.
<p>The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where
the project directory will be build.&nbsp; Furher, your Name and Email
adress are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top
of your source files as well as for entries in the *.lsm file.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.4"></a>4.4&nbsp; Porting existing projects to KDevelop</h2>
Existing projects can be converted to KDevelop projects by selecting "New"
from the project menu.&nbsp; The following dialog creates an empty project
file with your project name, version and type information as well as your
name and email adress.&nbsp; Then copy all your compilation and construction
files to the new project directory and choose "Add Files" from the project
menu.&nbsp; The files selected will be copied into your project directory
and the makefile.am's are updated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please change all Makefile.am
entries existing before the conversion towards the now created entries
done by KDevelop in the KDevelop area.&nbsp; Test, if your program can
still be compiled and installed after the conversion to ensure the project's
consistancy.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.5"></a>4.5&nbsp; Compiler options and compiling projects</h2>
The Project Options dialog , accessed by the project menu, lets you specify
all needed parameters for your project. Those will be updated in the makefile.am's
and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings
).&nbsp; After changing the project options, you should invoke "make clean"
or "rebuild all" to compile your project with the new options.&nbsp; Please
mind that debugging is only available if the project options are set to
create debugging information, the amount can be set with the debug level
(0-3).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you add functions that belong to a library that is
not included in the linker flags, your program will not link correctly
if those are not updated, so keep track of your library linking.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.6"></a>4.6&nbsp; The Output window</h2>
The output window has three different sub-tabs, which is "Messages" displaying
the compiler output.&nbsp; If errors occur, you can click on the message
and KDevelop will open the according file and place the cursor to the line
the error occured.
<br>"Stdin/Stdout" allows interaction with command-line programs, their
output is shown there as well as the input prompts.&nbsp; For running command-line
programs, this view will be opened automatically.
<br>"Stderr" shows all error messages that your program gives out, e.g.
for cerr &lt;&lt; (message)&nbsp; calls.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.7"></a>4.7&nbsp; The Classviewer and Fileviewers</h2>
The classviewer shows the classes of your project under the project item
as well as structs.&nbsp; Opening the tree will show all member functions
and members with symbols for private, protected and public, so you can
see the accessiblility of the member visually without switching to the
header file.&nbsp; Selecting the class name will open the according headerfile
containing the class and set the cursor to the class declaration beginning.
<br>Selecting member functions will open the implementation file and place
the cursor at the function header.&nbsp;&nbsp; For elements, KDevelop will
look for the header file and place the cursor at the line the element is
declarated.
<br>Mind that inline-functions are not supported by the classviewer.
<p>The Logical File Viewer (LFV) allows specifying filegroups to which
files can be filtered, e.g.&nbsp; a folder "pixmaps" or "headers".&nbsp;
Individual groups can be added by the properties entry of the project menu
or by a right click on the tree items.&nbsp; Selecting a file will open
it in the editing window, which is important e.g. to access the main()
function as it isn't a class and so not displayed in the classviewer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pixmaps will be opened automatically in the Tools-view by KIconedit if
it is installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right button menu of the LFV allows
configuring the file tree as well as adding, deleting or removing files
from the project.&nbsp; The project file and the Makefile.am's are updated
automatically in that case.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.8"></a>4.8&nbsp; Using the Documentation Browser</h2>
The documentation browser allows quick and easy access to all manuals and
documentations, including a search utility that is also present in the
editors.
<p>Accessing Help functionality:
<p>-in the editor, select the text you want to have help on or place the
cursor in the word that you want to look for.&nbsp; Then press the right
mouse button and select look up: &lt;expression> .This can also be done
by selectin "Search Marked Text" from the help menu, the shorcut key F3
or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.
<p>-in the Documentation browser select the text you want to look up and
press the right mouse button, select look up:&lt;expression> or select
"Search Marked Text" or the search icon as above.
<p>-if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help
on..." in the help menu or select the "Search for Help on..." icon from
the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression
you search for.
<p>Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according
icon in the "DOC" -tree-view or by the help menu entries.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.9"></a>4.9&nbsp; Creating a new class with the Class Generator</h2>
New classes can be added to your project by selecting "New Class" from
the project menu.&nbsp; The following dialog lets you enter all information
needed to construct a new class.&nbsp; First, you should enter the classname
which will also preset the filenames for the header and implementation
files.&nbsp; The Baseclass is the class the new class will inherit.&nbsp;
For Qt or KDE classes requiring QWidget as a baseclass, you can also check
the QWidget option.&nbsp; Further the inheritance from the baseclass can
be selected by public, protected and private.
<br>The "Documentation" field offers a place for a short description for
your class; this will be inserted into the header file for documentation
purposes and is placed there for KDoc to read.
<br>The affected Makefile.am will be updated with the new files created
and you can rebuild your project now containing your new class.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.10"></a>4.10 Adding new or existing files</h2>
Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate
your class implementation file into several ones.&nbsp; Then you need to
create an new file which will get the part of the class implementation
you want to move.&nbsp; You can specify which type the new file will be,
including a template for pixmap files often needed to create new toolbar
icons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new file will be added to the project and all affected
project files like Makefile.am etc will be updated.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.11"></a>4.11 File Properties</h2>
The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within
the LFV by a right mouseclick.&nbsp; It shows the project files in groups
as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file
size, file type and if the file is included in the project as well as the
installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's
make install command.&nbsp; It is important for documentation files as
well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when
the project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up
those locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; For standard KDE location macros you should
look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified.
<h2>
<a NAME="ss4.12"></a>4.12&nbsp; Accessable Tools</h2>
The tools-menu allows direct access to external tools.&nbsp; Those are
KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.&nbsp; If a tool is started, it will be
working in the "Tools" window and is closed automatically when you leave
KDevelop.
<br>Another way of starting KDbg is that you choose "Debug" from the "Build"
menu or the debug icon from the toolbar, starting KDbg with the project
binary.&nbsp; If the binary does not exist, you have to create it first
with invoking make or rebuild all.
<p>KIconedit can also be started by a click on the pixmap file in the LFV
you want to edit, loading the pixmap automatically.
