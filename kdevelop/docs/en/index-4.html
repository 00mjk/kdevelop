<H3><A NAME="Developing with KDevelop"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Development with KDevelop</A></H3>

<P>In this chapter you will get a general overview how you can use KDevelop and the internal Dialogeditor to create own applications.
Thereby, all tools are described by their use during the development process. If you are a beginner in C++/GUI design and
programming, you should read <B>"The KDevelop Programming Handbook"</B>, which describes some basics for program design and shows a
more detailed use of KDevelop by sample projects which you can follow step-by-step to get used with the way applications are
created using KDevelop. Also you should have read chapter 3, 
<A HREF="index-3.html#Programs">Programs</A> to gain a general understanding
why Unix applications should make use of provided development tools; this will make things easier when you hit references to what
Makefiles are etc.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 What are KDevelop Project Applications ?</A>
</H3>

<P>Projects created with KDevelop make it very easy for developers to use the GNU standard development tools. In opposition to the
self-creation of Makefiles, which have to be written anyway because of the project's complexity, those provide not only a better
way of Makefile generation but also a good and safe way to provide a fast adaption towards different sytems by autoconf-generated
<CODE>configure</CODE> scripts.
<P>The distribution of your applications does not require the end-user to have anything different installed than a C++ compiler and
the development libraries, which is most often the case; but you can as well distribute binary packages of your application. In
either way, the end-user of your product does not have to have KDevelop installed. For giving away your sources, we advise to
include the project file of KDevelop as well, as this makes it very easy for other developers to work with your sources if they
use KDevelop as well. For projects where several developers, maybe working on different places, are involved, this should the case
anyway to ensure consistancy of the Makefiles so you don't run into trouble. Especially on multilanguage applications, translators
won't actually work with the sourcecode, except in cases that require corrections for enabling translation support. Anyway, those
will be thankful as KDevelop simplifies their work to a minimum by adding their language and reducing the work to concentrate on
the translation.
<P>
<P>With using KDevelop for your own projects, you would start creating a new application with the KAppWizard. There, you can also
set the project type according the goals of your program. Then, you would start developing the user interface by adding
widgets that are already constructed in the libraries and only have to be called by your application, or by self-constructions
that can be made with the dialogeditor. Next comes the extension of the user interface by changing and extending those parts that
are already made by KDevelop like the statusbar, menubar and toolbars. As resources are collected in a resource file, this can be
extended simply by adding new values to the already existing one; the given resources can also be used as a guideline for adding
your specific ones. After implementing the functionality to methods that are either generated empty by the dialogeditor or already
containing code for standard user actions, you should extend the User Manual by simply editing the provided sgml index file
towards describing your applications capabilities. The last step would be to generate translation files and to distribute your
project to translators doing the rest to enhance internationalization.
<P>But even for non-GUI application designers the IDE offers an easy way to create new projects; the editor and classbrowser in
conjunction with KDevelop's powerful project management will reduce the time for development to the minimum that is required for
implementation of functionality.

<H3><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Short Description of KDevelop's Tools</A>
</H3>

<P>With KDevelop you have chosen a package, that, in conjuction with the use of other tools, will provide you a prefect and flexible
environment for object-orientated application development under Unix-Systems. Generally, KDevelop consists of the programming
environment and the dialogeditor; besides that all needed programs that can be helpful for designing applications are embedded in
one or the other way.
<P>
<H4>Programming Environment and Dialogeditor</H4>

<P>
<H4>The Programming Environment</H4>

<P>The Programming Environment is the user interface that KDevelop provides for creating and maintaining projects, implicitely using
many other tools by simplifying their use. It's build-in Editor and Helpbrowser as well as the Classbrowser reduce the amount of
work that development processes usually burden on the programmer. The ease of use make writing applications for Unix an enjoyment
on it's own and will allow t

<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Creating a new class with the Classgenerator</A>
</H3>

<P> New classes can be added to your project by
selecting "New Class" from the project menu. The following dialog lets you enter all information needed to construct a new class.
First, you should enter the classname which will also preset the filenames for the header and implementation files. The Baseclass
is the class the new class will inherit. For Qt or KDE classes requiring QWidget as a baseclass, you can also check the QWidget
option. Further the inheritance from the baseclass can be selected by public, protected and private. The "Documentation" field
offers a place for a short description for your class; this will be inserted into the header file for documentation purposes and
is placed there for KDoc to read. The affected Makefile.am will be updated with the new files created and you can rebuild your
project now containing your new class. 
<H3><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Adding new or existing files</A>
</H3>

<P> Adding a new file is often used when you think that
you should separate your class implementation file into several ones. Then you need to create an new file which will get the part
of the class implementation you want to move. You can specify which type the new file will be, including a template for pixmap
files often needed to create new toolbar icons. The new file will be added to the project and all affected project files like
Makefile.am etc will be updated. 
<H3><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 File Properties</A>
</H3>

<P> The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or
within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project files in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file
properties like file size, file type and if the file is included in the project as well as the installation path if the file is
going to be installed by the end-user's make install command.  It is important for documentation files as well as pixmaps to
specify the location where the files should go when the project is build and installed by end users, so you have to set up those
locations.   For standard KDE location macros you should look in your Makefile.am where the location macros are specified. 
<H3><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Accessable Tools</A>
</H3>

<P> The tools-menu allows direct access to external tools.  Those are KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  If a tool
is started, it will be working in the "Tools" window and is closed automatically when you leave KDevelop. Another way of starting
KDbg is that you choose "Debug" from the "Build" menu or the debug icon from the toolbar, starting KDbg with the project binary.
If the binary does not exist, you have to create it first with invoking make or rebuild all. KIconedit can also be started by a
click on the pixmap file in the LFV you want to edit, loading the pixmap automatically.
