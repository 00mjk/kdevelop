<H3><A NAME="s4">4. Usage </A></H3>

<P>After you've followed section 3, Configuration, KDevelop is set up for development.  It is sufficient to read the usage description
to get most of the IDE's capabilities and to know how to use the most needed functions available for creating applications and extending them.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 General Usage</A>
</H3>

<P>In Picture 4.1 you see the KDevelop main view with all window elements enabled.  Those are:
<P>- Menubar:                                                   gives access to all functions available
<P>- Standard toolbar:                  invokes most needed functions for editing and development creation.
<P>- Statusbar:                 displays the status of processes running as well as a quickhelp function for menuenties while those are highlighted.
Also it shows the status of the insert / overwrite mode for the editor and the position of the cursor in the active editing window by line and column.
<P>- Treeview:                  contains four tabulators for different treeview functions.  Those are: CV for the classviewer; displaying the project (KTest),
the project's classes (KTesApp) and class members (e.g. KTestApp()).  LFV stands for "logical file viewer"; showing the project files in groups and
giving easier access to files by grouptype.  The RFV ("real file viewer") shows the project directory tree as it is in the system's directory tree.
The most right tabulator, DOC, gives access to the documentation tree, making documentations available for the Documentation-Browser window.
<P>- Editview:                  displays the working windows for development. Sourcefiles will be opened in the "C/C++ Files" window, all other project-related
files including the headerfiles are connected to the "Header/Resource Files" window.  The Documentation-Browser window is intended to show this manual,
tutorials, library documentation and an index entries page after a search. Finally, the "Tools" window allows embedding third-party programs like KDbg,
KIconeditor and KTranslator.
<P>- Outputview:                contains three windows for cormpiler output,
<H3><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The Menubar</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 The Standard Toolbar</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 The Browser Toolbar</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 The Statusbar</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Keyboard Shortcuts</A>
</H3>

<P>All keyboard shortcuts can be configured in the keybindings dialog which is located in the KDevelop Setup, accessed by the options menu.
Note that standard key accelerators for e.g.  "New" or "Print" are configured by the KDE-Controll-Center, Configure Standard Keys.
The "Default" button will reset all changes and individual keybinding configuration to the default settings.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 New Projects with KAppWizard</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The KDevelop Application Wizard allows the creation of four different types of projects, constructing a framework for each.
All projects are FSF-compliant and use the GNU standard development tools as described in the requirements section of this handbook.
<P>For KDE applications, the wizard offers two different frameworks, the KDE-Application, providing a complete application with base classes
for document type, view and application. This includes the creation of a menubar, toolbar and statusbar, the mainwindow inherits the
KTMainWindow class. The KDE-Mini-Application only gives a view which is empty. This type of project can be used for the creation of small
desktop tools or other simple applications without too much change on the existing code provided by the framework.
<P>A Qt-Application offers the creation of a Qt-only program if you wish no dependencies towards the KDE-libraries for end-users.
(NOTE: The configure script still checks for the KDE-libraries.  This will be fixed in the next version of KDevelop).   
The Qt-Application also is created by using tree base classes like the KDE-standard-Application and provides a menubar, toolbar and statusbar.
<P>The C++ -Application type offers a framework for creating commandline applications.  It is ready to run and by default displays
"Hello World" as the only action.  This may be useful for C++ learners who would like to program applications without using a GUI
first or for those working on commandline programs written in C++ or C.
<P>The wizard asks for your project name, version and the location where the project directory will be build.  Furher, your Name
and Email adress are asked for inserting them in header and cpp templates on top of your source files as well as for entries in the *.lsm file.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Porting existing projects</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Existing projects can be converted to KDevelop projects by selecting "New" from the project menu.  The following dialog creates an
empty project file with your project name, version and type information as well as your name and email adress.  Then copy all your
compilation and construction files to the new project directory and choose "Add Files" from the project menu.  The files selected
will be copied into your project directory and the makefile.am's are updated.   Please change all Makefile.am entries existing before
the conversion towards the now created entries done by KDevelop in the KDevelop area.  Test, if your program can still be compiled and
installed after the conversion to ensure the project's consistancy.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 Compiler and Linker Options</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The Project Options dialog , accessed by the project menu, lets you specify all needed parameters for your project. Those will be
updated in the makefile.am's and the configure.in script (e.g. version number change or compiler warnings ).  After changing the
project options, you should invoke "make clean" or "rebuild all" to compile your project with the new options.  Please mind that
debugging is only available if the project options are set to create debugging information, the amount can be set with the debug level (0-3).
If you add functions that belong to a library that is not included in the linker flags, your program will not link correctly if those are not
updated, so keep track of your library linking.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 The Output Window</A>
</H3>

<P>The output window has three different sub-tabs, which is "Messages" displaying the compiler output.  If errors occur, you can click
on the message and KDevelop will open the according file and place the cursor to the line the error occured. "Stdin/Stdout" allows
interaction with command-line programs, their output is shown there as well as the input prompts.  For running command-line programs,
this view will be opened automatically. "Stderr" shows all error messages that your program gives out, e.g. for cerr &lt;&lt; (message)  calls.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.11">4.11 The Classviewer and Fileviewers</A>
</H3>

<P>The classviewer shows the classes of your project under the project item as well as structs.  Opening the tree will show all member
functions and members with symbols for private, protected and public, so you can see the accessiblility of the member visually without
switching to the header file.  Selecting the class name will open the according headerfile containing the class and set the cursor to
the class declaration beginning. Selecting member functions will open the implementation file and place the cursor at the function header.      
For elements, KDevelop will look for the header file and place the cursor at the line the element is declarated.        Mind that inline-functions
are not supported by the classviewer.
<P>The Logical File Viewer (LFV) allows specifying filegroups to which files can be filtered, e.g.  a folder "pixmaps" or "headers".
Individual groups can be added by the properties entry of the project menu or by a right click on the tree items.  Selecting a file
will open it in the editing window, which is important e.g. to access the main() function as it isn't a class and so not displayed
in the classviewer.   Pixmaps will be opened automatically in the Tools-view by KIconedit if it is installed.    The right button menu
of the LFV allows configuring the file tree as well as adding, deleting or removing files from the project.  The project file and the
Makefile.am's are updated automatically in that case.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 Using the Documentation Browser</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The documentation browser allows quick and easy access to all manuals and documentations, including a search utility that is also
present in the editors.
<P>Accessing Help functionality:
<P>-in the editor, select the text you want to have help on or place the cursor in the word that you want to look for.  Then press the right
mouse button and select look up: "expression" .This can also be done by selectin "Search Marked Text" from the help menu, the shorcut key
F3 or by selecting the Search icon from the toolbar.
<P>-in the Documentation browser select the text you want to look up and press the right mouse button, select look up:"expression" or select
"Search Marked Text" or the search icon as above.
<P>-if you want to search for a specific keyword, select "Search for Help on..." in the help menu or select the "Search for Help on..."
icon from the toolbar, opening a search dialog where you can enter the expression you search for.
<P>Direct access to specific documentation is given by selecting the according icon in the "DOC" -tree-view or by the help menu entries.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.13">4.13 Creating a new class with the Classgenerator</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>New classes can be added to your project by selecting "New Class" from the project menu.  The following dialog lets you enter all
information needed to construct a new class.  First, you should enter the classname which will also preset the filenames for the header
and implementation files.  The Baseclass is the class the new class will inherit.  For Qt or KDE classes requiring QWidget as a baseclass,
you can also check the QWidget option.  Further the inheritance from the baseclass can be selected by public, protected and private.
The "Documentation" field offers a place for a short description for your class; this will be inserted into the header file for documentation
purposes and is placed there for KDoc to read. The affected Makefile.am will be updated with the new files created and you can rebuild your
project now containing your new class.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.14">4.14 Adding new or existing files</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Adding a new file is often used when you think that you should separate your class implementation file into several ones.
Then you need to create an new file which will get the part of the class implementation you want to move.  You can specify which
type the new file will be, including a template for pixmap files often needed to create new toolbar icons.   The new file will be
added to the project and all affected project files like Makefile.am etc will be updated.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.15">4.15 File Properties</A>
</H3>

<P>The file properties dialog can be accessed via the project menu or within the LFV by a right mouseclick.  It shows the project files
in groups as they are sorted in the LFV and displays the file properties like file size, file type and if the file is included in the
project as well as the installation path if the file is going to be installed by the end-user's make install command.  It is important
for documentation files as well as pixmaps to specify the location where the files should go when the project is build and installed by
end users, so you have to set up those locations.   For standard KDE location macros you should look in your Makefile.am where the
location macros are specified.
<H3><A NAME="ss4.16">4.16 Acsessable Tools</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The tools-menu allows direct access to external tools.  Those are KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  If a tool is started, it will be
working in the "Tools" window and is closed automatically when you leave KDevelop. Another way of starting KDbg is that you choose
"Debug" from the "Build" menu or the debug icon from the toolbar, starting KDbg with the project binary.  If the binary does not exist,
you have to create it first with invoking make or rebuild all.
<P>KIconedit can also be started by a click on the pixmap file in the LFV you want to edit, loading the pixmap automatically.
