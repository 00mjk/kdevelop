<H3><A NAME="Overview"></A> <A NAME="s4">4. Overview</A></H3>

<P>Looking at KDevelop, the user interface can be described by it's logical separation: the main window, the treeview and the
outputwindow, surrounded by the menubar, toolbars and the statusbar. This section describes the purpose of each part of the
interface, starting by the windows, followed by the bars and the functions they provide.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Main Window </A>
</H3>

<P>The main window consists of four tabulators for which the left two are for editing purpose. First comes the Header-/Resource
window for headers and any other text files like the documentation sgml's, then the C/C++ window for sourcecodes. These are
followed by the Documentation window displaying in HTML-format. At last is the Tools window for external programs like KIconedit
and KDbg which are embedded into the IDE. Any Tool that is registered can be accessed via the Tools-menu; whereas the
registration of third-party programs can easily be done by a configuration dialog (see the 
<@@ref>Configurationconfiguration</A> section). For a description of the Editor windows functionality, see 
<@@ref>Configurationconfiguration</A><@@ref>The EditorThe Editor</A>, and for the Helpbrowser, you should look at section 
<@@ref>Configurationconfiguration</A><@@ref>The EditorThe Editor</A><@@ref>The Documetation BrowserThe Documentation Browser</A>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 The Classviewer and Fileviewers</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>The Classviewer</H4>

<P>The classviewer shows the classes of your project as well as global functions and variables.  Opening the tree will show all
member functions and members with symbols for attributes (private, protected and public, signals and slots), so you can see the
properties of members visually without switching to the header file.  Selecting the class name will open the according
headerfile containing the class and set the cursor to the class declaration beginning. Selecting member functions will open the
implementation file and place the cursor at the function header.        For elements, KDevelop will look for the header file and place
the cursor at the line the element is declarated.       The classviewer also provides popup-menus that offer more specified options,
see 
<@@ref>The ClassviewerThe Classviewer</A> for more detailed information.
<P>
<H4>The Logical File Viewer</H4>

<P>The Logical File Viewer (LFV) allows sorting files by filters in groups. Individual groups can be added by the properties
entry of the project menu or by a right click on the tree items. This allows a more specialized search for files that you want to
access quickly, in the first place only showing project-included files. According to their Mime-type, the files will be opened
when selected. You will like the LFV for things like selecting pixmaps- this will start KIconEdit (if installed on the system) in
the Tools-window and opens the chosen picture.
<P>
<H4>The Real File Viewer</H4>

<P>The Real File Viewer (RFV) shows the project directory tree with all files, so you can edit non-project files or files hidden by
the LFV like configure.in and Makefiles.
Popup-menus also provide functions like adding or removing files to the current project.
<P>
<H4>The Documentation Tree</H4>

<P>The Documentation Tree (DOC) displays all available HTML-based documentation that is configured as books. Selecting a book will
open the first page in the Browser window. Also, a popup-menu provides personal configuration for additional HTML-based
documentation packages.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Output window</A>
</H3>

<P> The Output window is separated as well into a messages window, a stdin/stdout
window and a stderr window for the following necessities:
<UL>
<LI> messages window:   displays all output of the compiler. Clicking on error messages will change the edit widget to set the
cursor to the line the compiler found an error.</LI>
<LI> stdout window: display for terminal based applications that send messages to the standard output of the computer. Note that
Terminal applications are now started in an external console window.</LI>
<LI> stderr window: displays all the error messages your program
produces. This is useful for testing purposes. The Output window is programmed to show up each time an external process is called,
such as make or a terminal application.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
