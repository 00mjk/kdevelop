<a NAME="s2"></a>2. Installation</h2>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss2.1"></a>2.1 How to obtain KDevelop</h2>

<blockquote>KDevelop can be found either on the&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.kde.org/current.html">KDE
Applications page</a>&nbsp; or on the <a href="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">KDevelop
homepage.</a>
<br>There, we offer weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository for
those who want to stay up to date with KDevelop.
<br>Also we offer a mailinglist for users having problems, found bugs or
have new ideas.
<p>If you have any problems compiling and/or running, please do the following:
<p>- read the "Questions and Answers" section of this manual or the FAQ-
file included with the KDevelop package
<br>If those don't adress your problems, please subscribe to the mailinglist
and send your questions there, as the mass of questions can't be adressed
by the developers if they come on several places and thus questions regarding
the same problems have to be answered several times.
<p>Thank you for your attention and understanding,
<p>The KDevelop Team.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss2.2"></a>2.2 Requirements</h2>

<blockquote>In order to successfully compile and use KDevelop, you need
following programs and libraries.
<p>gcc/g++ 2.7.2.1 (or compatible)
<br>perl 5.004
<br>autoconf 2.12
<br>automake 1.2
<p>Qt 1.42
<br>KDE 1.1
<p>KDevelop was tested under SuSE Linux&nbsp; 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB
RAM and under FreeBSD 3.0-Release on an Intel 200 MMX, 128MB RAM.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Optional:</h4>
KDE-SDK from 31.08.98 or newer for KDoc and ksgml2html (&nbsp; with sgmltools
1.0&nbsp; )
<p>glimpse 4.0 for the search index
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For creating the KDE library documentation, you need the kdelibs package
in source available on your system as provided by the KDE project.
<br>To use the C/C++ Reference, you should download our reference offered
on the KDevelop homepage.&nbsp; Copy the package as root into&nbsp; your
KDE directory and untar it, then the reference is available&nbsp; in the
documenation, otherwise choosing the reference will show an error page.</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="ss2.3"></a>2.3 Compilation and installation</h2>

<blockquote>In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type
the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>% ./configure
<br>% make
<p>change as `root` and type:
<p>% make install</blockquote>
Since KDevelop uses
<br>autoconf
<br>you should have not trouble compiling it.
<p>In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %
make -f Makefile.cvs
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
% ./configure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
% make
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change
as `root` and type:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %
make install
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>If you use KDE as your windowmanager, KDevelop can be started either
with choosing "K"->"Applications"->"KDevelop".
<p>Selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the KDevelop
project icon) will start KDevelop and load the project.
<br>This can also be done by commandline, adding the project filename.
<p>If you have any prior version of KDevelop installed, please delete your
local kdeveloprc file which is located in your home directory under
<br>.kde/share/config/kdeveloprc.
<p>The first start of KDevelop will invoke the automatic installation process,
which is only executed once.&nbsp; If your installation is messed up, please
delete
<br>your kdeveloprc file as well and restart KDevelop, the automatic installation
will be called again to set up KDevelop according to your system.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
The KDevelop Installation Program:</h4>
Since version 0.3, KDevelop includes an automatic installation program
module, which is invoked when KDevelop is started the first time or if
your
<br>kdeveloprc file does not exist.&nbsp; We advise following the installation
steps by choosing "Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set
up your KDevelop environment.
<p>The KDevelop Installation dialog offers the following options:
<p>Help:&nbsp; Will open&nbsp; the KDEHelp program and open this page.
<p>Cancel:&nbsp; Will show a warning message that the installation process
is going to be cancelled.&nbsp; This warning message allows to return to
the installation ("Back") or continue without installing KDevelop correctly
("Continue").&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose "Continue", the installation process
will be exited and KDevelop will start.&nbsp; In this case, you will have
to set up your enviroment manually by choosing "KDevelop Setup" in the
Options menu.
<p>Proceed:
<p>This will actually start the installation process and execute actions
in the following order:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Checking for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make, gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake
and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications generated
by KDevelop.&nbsp; If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set
automatically to use gmake.&nbsp; Other comandline options to your make
program can be set in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu later.</li>

<li>
Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.&nbsp; Those will allow to create a new KDE-library
documentation and a search index automatically in a later setup step.</li>

<li>
Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.&nbsp;
Either one of these programs have to be installed to allow correct printing.</li>

<li>
Checking for KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.&nbsp; We advise to install
those programs as they are good helpers to create complete KDE-applications</li>

<li>
Showing the summary dialog.&nbsp; All tested programs are listed with found
or not found, additional hints are given, if a needed program is recommended.</li>

<li>
Then follows the detection of your Qt-online documentation path.&nbsp;
This checks for several standard path in your system for the documentation
and sets the path automatically.&nbsp; If your Qt-Documentation could not
be found, a message will appear that allows you to set the correct path
or continue without setting the path.&nbsp; Choosing to set the path will
return to the main installation window and shows a path editing filed with
a button on the right of it.&nbsp; Choosing this button will open a directory
selection dialog, where you can switch to the directory the documentation
is located. Usually this is in the qt/html directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; After
doing so, the installation can continue with the selection of "Proceed"
again.</li>

<li>
If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE-library documentation.&nbsp;
For that, you need to have the kde-libraries in source form.&nbsp; For
Linux-Users who have installed KDE from a distribution, we advise to copy
and extract the source of the kdelibs-package to your system; FreeBSD users
who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; If none of these
cases can be fullfilled, you should download the sources from <a href="http://www.kde.org">www.kde.org</a>
and untar the sources on your system to create a documentation.&nbsp; If
you wish to use the documentation package provided by <a href="http://developer.kde.org">developer.kde.org</a>,
you can cancel the creation and continue with creating the search index.
Mind that the path to your kde-library documentation has to be set manually
in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu then.</li>

<li>
The "Update KDE-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default
path for the location of the documentation to create in $(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.&nbsp;
The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library sources
with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your documentation should
be created using the khtml&nbsp; or th khtmlw library.&nbsp; We advise
to use khtml as khtmlw is older and exists for compatibility reasons. New
applications using HTML widgets should use khtml.&nbsp; To avoid confusion
while programming, we decided to only include one of those for documentation.&nbsp;
If you are working on applications that use khtmlw, you should create a
different documentation with the KDevelop Setup in the options menu and
use khtmlw then.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the creation of the documentation,
a message in the installation window shows that it is in progress and you
should wait for the next message.</li>

<li>
If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered
to create a searchdatabase.&nbsp; The searchdatabase can be created with
the options of including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation.&nbsp;
Additionally the online documentation of KDevelop is included and will
be indexed.&nbsp; If you have other documentation that should be indexed
you can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as
well.&nbsp; If you wish to have direct access to these documentations,
you have to add them to the documentation tree later in KDevelop by a right-button
click on the "Others" folder, offering the addition of other documentations.</li>

<li>
During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show
a message that this is in progress.</li>

<li>
If all installation steps were done correctly,&nbsp; a final message shows
that KDevelop will be started after pressing OK and you are ready to start.</li>
</ol>
Mind that you can set up additional options in the "KDevelop Setup" dialog
that can be accessed by the options menu.
