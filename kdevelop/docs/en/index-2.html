<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>KDevelop can be found either on the KDE Applications page (
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/current.html">http://www.kde.org/current.html</A>) or on the KDevelop homepage (
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html</A>).
KDevelop is also available on Linux distributions, such as SuSE 6.1.
<P>We're offering weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository on our homepage for those who want to stay up to date with
KDevelop. Usually, the snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight
into development progress of the KDevelop team. Also we offer various third party software needed by KDevelop directly such as
KDoc and KDbg.
<P>If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the 
<A HREF="index-13.html#Questions and Answers">Questions and Answers</A> section of this handbook or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop package. If your problem is not addressed, please
subscribe to the KDevelop mailinglist at 
<A HREF="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de">kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de</A> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe" as contents. Requests and problem report
should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any implementation problem you may have
while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailinglist should be written in English, so that all participants can
take part on discussions and are able to provide better help. The mailinglist is also intended for those users willing to contribute
and who found solutions for any problems they experienced, so we can fix errors and include that knowledge to give beginners an even
more qualified first-hand help.
An good way to report problems is to send the output you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal Messages-window.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>

<P>KDevelop was tested with SuSE Linux 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB RAM and FreeBSD 3.0-Release as well as SuSE Linux 6.0 on an Intel
200 MMX, 128MB RAM.
<P>As far as known to the authors, SuSE Linux and FreeBSD contain all necessary packages, including a2ps and enscript as packages or
rpm's, so you should have no problem installing the required third-party software.
<P><B>Documentation:</B>        
<P>For creating the KDE library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your
system as provided by the KDE project or included with the source packages of your distribution and <B>KDoc</B> (included in the
KDE-SDK).
<P>Also we're offering a C/C++ Reference on our homepage at 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html</A> that is integrated into the documentation browser after it's
installation. Download the package and copy the source file as <CODE>root</CODE> into your KDE directory and untar it with <CODE>tar zxvf
c_c++_reference.tar.gz</CODE>, then the reference is available in the documentation tree; otherwise selecting the reference book in the
browser shows an error page with the KDevelop homepage URL offering a download and describes the installation process.
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and Installation</A>
</H3>

<P>In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % ./configure
        % make

        (as root)
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>Since KDevelop uses <CODE>autoconf</CODE> you should have not trouble compiling it.
<P>In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % make -f Makefile.cvs
        % ./configure
        % make

        change as `root` and type:
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If your system's make-command is <CODE>gmake</CODE>, type <CODE>gmake</CODE> instead of <CODE>make</CODE>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Starting KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>If you use KDE as your window manager, KDevelop can be started either with choosing
"K"-&gt;"Applications"-&gt;"KDevelop"-&gt;"KDevelop 0.4". As KDevelop supports KDE-Mime-types, you can also start by selecting a
KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the KDevelop project icon) in the KDE File Manager which will start KDevelop
and load the project.
Under other window managers, open a console and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% kdevelop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To start Kdevelop with an existing project, change into the project-directory and type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        
% kdevelop  &lt;yourProject&gt;.kdevprj
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under each user account KDevelop will invoke the 
<A HREF="#The Installation Program">automatic installation</A> process on the
first start, allowing a quick configuration of the most needed options. If your installation is messed up, you can reconfigure KDevelop
any time either by entering
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        
% kdevelop  --setup
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>or, when using KDE, by choosing "K"-&gt;"Applications"-&gt;"KDevelop"-&gt;"Setup".
<P>
<H3><A NAME="The Installation Program"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 The Installation Program</A>
</H3>

<P>KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module which is invoked whenever Kdevelop is started and the configuration file
kdeveloprc does not exist. We suggest you follow the installation steps by choosing "Proceed" to automatically check your system and to
set up your KDevelop environment.
<P>The Installation dialog's buttons execute the following actions:
<P><B>Help:</B>  Will open  the KDEHelp program.
<P><B>Proceed:</B> This starts the installation process and executes the following actions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Checking for make/gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications
generated by KDevelop. If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other comandline options
to your make program can be set in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu later, an introduction into development under Unix is
explained in section 
<A HREF="index-3.html#Programs">Programs</A>.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.  Those will allow to create a new KDE-library documentation and a search index
automatically in a later setup step if found.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.  Either one of these programs have to be installed to
allow correct printing. If neither program is installed, you can do this at any time lateron at your option without having to run the
setup again.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  We encourage you to install those programs as they are good
helpers for creating complete KDE-applications. Note that KDbg is used directly for debugging your current project within
KDevelop; KIconedit is used to display and edit pixmaps selected in the file-viewer trees. The programs KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator
are then configured to be available in the "Tools" menu of the KDevelop menu bar if they are found. Other tools can be added to the
Tools-menu by selecting "Tools..." in the Options menu later.
</LI>
<LI> Summary of detected programs: the installer lists those programs it found and those it didn't. Additional hints are given, if a
needed program is recommended.
</LI>
<LI>Detection of your Qt-online documentation path: this checks for several standard paths in your system for the documentation and
sets the path automatically. If your Qt-Documentation could not be found either because it is not installed or your system keeps it at
a different location, a message will appear that asks you to set the correct path manually or to continue. Choosing the button to set
the path will return to the main installation window and shows an editing field with a button on the right of it to choose the path.
Usually this is in the qt/html directory. After doing so, the installation can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.
</LI>
<LI> If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed KDE from a distribution, we suggest to copying and extracting
the source of the kdelibs-package to your system; Free BSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases match your situation, you should download the sources from 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A> and untar the sources on your system. If you wish to use the documentation package
provided by 
<A HREF="http://developer.kde.org">http://developer.kde.org</A>, cancel the creation and continue with creating
the search index. After the installer finished and KDevelop has been started, set the path to the extracted documentation package in
the KDevelop Setup dialog and run the search index setup again, which can be found at the same setup page of the dialog.

The "Update KDE-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation in
$(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library sources you
extracted on the sytem with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. As an example, if you got the kdelibs.tar.gz
package from 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A> and downloaded it to your home directory, you should open a
console or terminal and enter "tar zxvf kdelibs.tar.gz". This will untar the sources into a directory $HOME/kdelibs, which then
contains the sources for each library in a subdirectory, e.g. for kdecore, this would be in /home/rnolden/kdelibs/kdecore. Now, the
path you have to enter in the KDE-Library documentation dialog would be the path to all libraries, in the example
/home/rnolden/kdelibs.

If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your documentation should be created using the khtml or the khtmlw library. Both are
providing a HTML-widget which are used to create windows that can display HTML files and is used by KDEHelp and KFM. As the classes are
the same in both libraries, we decided to include only one library for documentation to avoid confusion due to the fact that the header
files containing the classes differ in their filename. After pressing the OK button, a message in the installation window shows that it
is in progress and you should wait for the next message.
<P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> On a multi-user system or systems with disk-quotas for user accounts, the installation of a complete HTML documentation
for each user would be a waste of disk space. In this case, ask your system administrator to run KDevelop under the root account to
allow write access to the system's root directory. Then install the documentation within the KDE-directory, under
$KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation. The correct path can then be set up later in the KDevelop setup dialog, available in the
"Options"-menu.
<P>
</LI>
<LI> If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered to create a search database. The
search database can be created with the options of including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation (default). Additionally
the KDevelop documentation is included and will be indexed.  If you have other documentation that you want indexed you
can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well.
</LI>
<LI> During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.
</LI>
<LI> If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message states that KDevelop will be started
after pressing OK. Mind that you can set up additional options like auto saving in the
<A HREF="index-12.html#General Configuration">KDevelop Setup</A> dialog that can be accessed through the options menu.</LI>
</OL>
<P><B>Cancel:</B>  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be canceled.  This warning message allows you
to return to the installation ("Back") or to start KDevelop with the default values ("Continue"). Mind that in this case you will have
to set all options yourself with the configuration dialogs provided in the options-menu.
