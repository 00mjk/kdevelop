<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>KDevelop can be found either on the 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/current.html">KDE Applications page</A>
or on the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">KDevelop homepage</A>.
<P>There, we offer weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository for those who want to stay up to date with KDevelop. Usually, the
snapshots are not intended to be used for production but as a test for new features and to give an insight into development
progress of the KDevelop team.
<P>If you're experiencing problems with compiling or using KDevelop, please read the 
<A HREF="index-12.html#Questions and Answers">Questions and Answers</A> section of this manual or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop
package. If your problem is not addressed, please subscribe to the 
<A HREF="mailto:kdevelop@fara3.cs.uni-potsdam.de">KDevelop mailinglist</A> by sending a mail with an empty header and "subscribe" as contents.
<P>Requests and problem report should only target the usage of the KDevelop IDE and not towards any questions that regard any
implementation problem you may have while coding your own application. Anyway, all mails send to the mailinglist should be
written in english, so that all participants can take part on discussions and are able to provide better help.
<P>The mailinglist is also intended for those users willing to contribute and who found solutions for any problems they experienced,
so we can fix errors and include that knowledge to give beginners an even more qualified first-hand help.
<P>An good way to report problems is to send the output you get by starting kdevelop from the console or to copy and paste the
contents of KDevelop's internal Messages-window.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>

<P>KDevelop was tested with SuSE Linux 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB RAM and FreeBSD 3.0-Release as well as SuSE Linux 6.0 on an Intel
200 MMX, 128MB RAM.
<P><B>Documentation:</B>        For creating the KDE library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your
system as provided by the KDE project or included with the source packages of your distribution and <B>KDoc</B> (included in the
KDE-SDK).
<P>Also we're offering a C/C++ Reference on our 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">homepage</A> that is integrated into the documentation browser after it's installation. Download the package and
copy the source file as <CODE>root</CODE> into your KDE directory and untar it with <CODE>tar zxvf c_c++_reference.tar.gz</CODE>, then the
reference is available in the documenation tree; otherwise selecting the reference book in the browser shows an error page with
the KDevelop homepage URL offering a download and describes the installation process.

<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and Installation</A>
</H3>

<P>In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % ./configure
        % make

        (as root)
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>Since KDevelop uses <CODE>autoconf</CODE> you should have not trouble compiling it.
<P>In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % make -f Makefile.cvs
        % ./configure
        % make

        change as `root` and type:
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If your system's make-command is <CODE>gmake</CODE>, type <CODE>gmake</CODE> instead of <CODE>make</CODE>.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Starting KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>If you use KDE as your windowmanager, KDevelop can be started either with choosing "K"->"Applications"->"KDevelop". As KDevelop
supports KDE-Mime-types, you can also start by selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the KDevelop project
icon) in the KDE File Manager which will start KDevelop and load the project.
<P>Under other windowmanagers, open a console and type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % kdevelop
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Starting KDevelop with a certain project would be to change into the project-directory and to type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        
% kdevelop  &lt;yourProject&gt;.kdevprj
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under each user account KDevelop will invoke the 
<A HREF="#The Installation Program">automatic installation</A> process on the
first start, allowing a quick configuration of the most needed options. If your installation is messed up, please delete your
kdeveloprc file and restart KDevelop, the automatic installation will be called again to set up KDevelop according to your system.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="The Installation Program"></A> <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 The Installation Program</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module, which is invoked when starting the first time under the current user
account; meaning that the user's configuration file does not exist.  We advise following the installation steps by choosing
"Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set up your KDevelop environment.
<P>The Installation dialog's buttons execute the following actions:
<P><B>Help:</B>  Will open  the KDEHelp program and open this page.
<P><B>Proceed:</B>  This will actually start the installation process and execute actions in the following order:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Checking for make/gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications
generated by KDevelop. If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other comandline options
to your make program can be set in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu later.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.  Those will allow to create a new KDE-library documentation and a search index automatically
in a later setup step if found.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.  Either one of these programs have to be installed to
allow correct printing.
</LI>
<LI> Checking for KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  We advise to install those programs as they are good helpers to create
complete KDE-applications. Note that KDbg is used directly for debugging your current project within KDevelop; KIconedit is used
to display and edit pixmaps selected in the file-viewer trees. The programs KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator are then configured to
be available in the "Tools" menu of the KDevelop menubar if they are found. Other tools can be added to the Tools-menu by
selecting "Tools..." in the Options menu later.
</LI>
<LI> Showing the summary dialog.  All tested programs are listed with found or not found, additional hints are given, if a
needed program is recommended.
</LI>
<LI> Then follows the detection of your Qt-online documentation path.  This checks for several standard path in your system for
the documentation and sets the path automatically.  If your Qt-Documentation could not be found, a message will appear that asks
you to set the correct path or to continue.  Choosing to set the path will return to the main installation window and shows an
editing field with a button on the right of it.  Choosing this button will open a directory selection dialog, where you can
switch to the directory the documentation is located. Usually this is in the qt/html directory. After doing so, the installation
can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.
</LI>
<LI> If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the
kde-libraries in source form. For Linux-Users who have installed KDE from a distribution, we advise to copy and extract the source
of the kdelibs-package to your system; FreeBSD users who installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according
distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases can be fullfilled, you should download the sources from
<A HREF="www.kde.org">www.kde.org</A> and untar the sources on your system to create a documentation.  If you wish to use
the documentation package provided by 
<A HREF="developer.kde.org">developer.kde.org</A>, you can cancel the creation and
continue with creating the search index. Mind that the path to your kde-library documentation has to be set manually in the setup
dialog accessed by the options menu then.
</LI>
<LI> The "Update KDE-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation to
create in $(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library
sources with the selection button on top of the dialog and press OK. If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your
documentation should be created using the khtml  or the khtmlw library.  We advise to use khtml as khtmlw is older and exists for
compatibility reasons. New applications using HTML widgets should use khtml.  To avoid confusion while programming, we decided to
only include one of those for documentation.  If you are working on applications that use khtmlw, you should create a different
documentation with the KDevelop Setup in the options menu and use khtmlw then.    During the creation of the documentation, a
message in the installation window shows that it is in progress and you should wait for the next message.

<B>NOTE:</B> On a multi-user system or systems with disk-quotas for user accounts, the creation of a complete HTML documentation
for each user would be a mere waste of diskspace. In this case, ask you system administrator to run KDevelop under the
root account to allow write access to the system's root directory. The we advise to create the documentation within the
KDE-directory, under $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation. The correct path can then be set up later in the KDevelop
setup dialog, available in the "Options"-menu.
</LI>
<LI> If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered to create a searchdatabase. The
searchdatabase can be created with the options of including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation (default). Additionally
the online documentation of KDevelop is included and will be indexed.  If you have other documentation that should be indexed you
can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well. If you wish to have direct access to these
documentations, you have to add them to the documentation tree later in KDevelop by a right-button click on the "Others" folder,
offering the addition of other documentations.
</LI>
<LI> During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.
</LI>
<LI> If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message shows that KDevelop will be started
after pressing OK and you are ready to start. Mind that you can set up additional options like autosaving in the "KDevelop Setup"
dialog that can be accessed by the options menu.</LI>
</OL>
<P><B>Cancel:</B>  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be cancelled.  This warning message allows to
return to the installation ("Back") or to start KDevelop with the default values ("Continue"). Mind that in this case you have to
set all options yourself with the configuration dialogs provided in the options-menu.
