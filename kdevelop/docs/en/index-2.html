<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain KDevelop</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>KDevelop can be found either on the 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/current.html">KDE Applications page</A>
or on the 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/~smeier/kdevelop/index.html">KDevelop homepage</A>.
<P>There, we offer weekly snapshots of the KDevelop CVS repository for those who want to stay up to date with KDevelop.
Also we offer a mailinglist for users having problems, found bugs or have new ideas.
<P>If you have any problems compiling and/or running, please read the "Questions and Answers" section of this manual or the FAQ-file included with the KDevelop package.
If those don't adress your problems, please subscribe to the mailinglist and send your questions there, as the mass of questions can't be adressed by the developers if
they come on several places and thus questions regarding the same problems have to be answered several times.
<P>Thank you for your attention and understanding,
<P>The KDevelop Team.

<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>In order to successfully compile and use KDevelop, you need the following programs and libraries.
<P>gcc/g++ 2.7.2.1 (or compatible)
<P>perl 5.004
<P>autoconf 2.12
<P>automake 1.2
<P>Qt 1.42
<P>KDE 1.1
<P>
<P>KDevelop was tested under SuSE Linux 5.2 on an AMD K6 200, 64MB
RAM and under FreeBSD 3.0-Release on an Intel 200 MMX, 128MB RAM.
<P>
<P>Optional:
<P>KDE-SDK from 31.08.98 or newer for KDoc and ksgml2html ( with sgmltools 1.0 )
<P>glimpse 4.0 for the search index
<P>For creating the KDE library documentation, you need the kdelibs package in source available on your system as provided by the KDE project.
To use the C/C++ Reference, you should download our reference offered on the KDevelop homepage. Copy the package as root into your
KDE directory and untar it, then the reference is available in the documenation, otherwise choosing the reference will show an error page.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and Installation</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install KDevelop on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the KDevelop distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % ./configure
        % make

        (as root)
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Since KDevelop uses 
<PRE>
autoconf
</PRE>
 you should have not trouble compiling it.
<P>In order to compile the KDevelop CVS snapshot, type the following :
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        % make -f Makefile.cvs
        % ./configure
        % make

        change as `root` and type:
        
        % make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<P>If you use KDE as your windowmanager, KDevelop can be started either with choosing "K"->"Applications"->"KDevelop".
<P>Selecting a KDevelop project file ("*.kdevprj", displayed with the KDevelop project icon) will start KDevelop and load the project. This can also be done
by commandline, adding the project filename.
<P>If you have any prior version of KDevelop installed, please delete your local kdeveloprc file which is located in your home directory under
.kde/share/config/kdeveloprc.
<P>The first start of KDevelop will invoke the automatic installation process, which is only executed once.  If your installation is messed up, please delete
your kdeveloprc file as well and restart KDevelop, the automatic installation will be called again to set up KDevelop according to your system.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The KDevelop Installation Program:</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>Since version 0.3, KDevelop includes an automatic installation program module, which is invoked when KDevelop is started the first time or if your
kdeveloprc file does not exist.  We advise following the installation steps by choosing "Proceed" to automatically check your system and to set up your
KDevelop environment.
<P>The KDevelop Installation dialog offers the following options:
<P>Help:  Will open  the KDEHelp program and open this page.
<P>Cancel:  Will show a warning message that the installation process is going to be cancelled.  This warning message allows to return to the installation
("Back") or continue without installing KDevelop correctly ("Continue").   If you choose "Continue", the installation process will be exited and KDevelop
will start.  In this case, you will have to set up your enviroment manually by choosing "KDevelop Setup" in the Options menu.
<P>Proceed:
<P>This will actually start the installation process and execute actions in the following order:
<P>
<P>1. Checking for    make, gmake, autoconf, autoheader, automake and perl for the creation and compilation of new applications generated by KDevelop.
If gmake is installed, the make-command will be set automatically to use gmake.  Other comandline options to your make program can be set in the setup
dialog accessed by the options menu later.
<P>2. Checking for KDoc and Glimpse.  Those will allow to create a new KDE-library documentation and a search index automatically in a later setup step.
3. Checking for a2ps and enscript to ensure that printing is available.  Either one of these programs have to be installed to allow correct printing.
4. Checking for KDbg, KIconedit and KTranslator.  We advise to install those programs as they are good helpers to create complete KDE-applications
5. Showing the summary dialog.  All tested programs are listed with found or not found, additional hints are given, if a needed program is recommended.
6. Then follows the detection of your Qt-online documentation path.  This checks for several standard path in your system for the documentation and sets
the path automatically.  If your Qt-Documentation could not be found, a message will appear that allows you to set the correct path or continue without setting
the path.  Choosing to set the path will return to the main installation window and shows a path editing filed with a button on the right of it.  Choosing this
button will open a directory selection dialog, where you can switch to the directory the documentation is located. Usually this is in the qt/html directory.
After doing so, the installation can continue with the selection of "Proceed" again.
<P>7. If KDoc was detected, you are asked to create/update your KDE-library documentation.  For that, you need to have the kde-libraries in source form.
For Linux-Users who have installed KDE from a distribution, we advise to copy and extract the source of the kdelibs-package to your system; FreeBSD users who
installed the kdelibs as a package should look for their according distfile package of the ports-collection.   If none of these cases can be fullfilled, you should
download the sources from www.kde.org and untar the sources on your system to create a documentation.  If you wish to use the documentation package provided by
developer.kde.org, you can cancel the creation and continue with creating the search index. Mind that the path to your kde-library documentation has to be set
manually in the setup dialog accessed by the options menu then.
<P>8. The "Update KDE-Library documentation" dialog is set up to use a default path for the location of the documentation to create in
$(HOME)/.kde/share/apps/kdevelop/KDE-Documentation.  The only thing you have to do is choosing the path to your library sources with the selection button on top
of the dialog and press OK.   If the path was set correctly, you are asked if your documentation should be created using the khtml  or th khtmlw library.  We advise
to use khtml as khtmlw is older and exists for compatibility reasons. New applications using HTML widgets should use khtml.  To avoid confusion while programming, we
decided to only include one of those for documentation.  If you are working on applications that use khtmlw, you should create a different documentation with the
KDevelop Setup in the options menu and use khtmlw then.    During the creation of the documentation, a message in the installation window shows that it is in progress
and you should wait for the next message.
<P>9. If the system check found the Glimpse program on your system, you are offered to create a searchdatabase.  The searchdatabase can be created with the options of
including the KDE-documentation and the Qt-documentation.  Additionally the online documentation of KDevelop is included and will be indexed.  If you have other
documentation that should be indexed you can select the directories and add them to the indexing process as well.  If you wish to have direct access to these
documentations, you have to add them to the documentation tree later in KDevelop by a right-button click on the "Others" folder, offering the addition of other
documentations.
10. During the creation of the search index, the installation window will show a message that this is in progress.
11. If all installation steps were done correctly,  a final message shows that KDevelop will be started after pressing OK and you are ready to start.
<P>Mind that you can set up additional options in the "KDevelop Setup" dialog that can be accessed by the options menu.
