 * It stores the icon name as extracted from the template description together with
 * the path to the archive. Only on demand will the icon file tried to be loaded and
 * returned as pixmap object.
 * To support also legacy template installations with the preview image installed as separate file,
 * the local directory prefix in the QStandardPaths::GenericDataLocation is stored as well
 * to search also those paths as fallback.
 *
 * If the icon name is empty, no matching icon file could be found or no image successfully loaded,
 * the returned pixmap will default to a themed "kdevelop" icon image (128x128).
