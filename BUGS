Classparser bugs:

(1) 
class x {
	 x::y( );
};
The classparser stops at "::" and recognizes this as an implementation.
That can't easily be avoided with the current cp (see ClassParser::checkClassDecl( ) )

(2)
struct x {
  struct y {
    float f;
  };
} s1, s2;
Clicking at the treeview for jumping to f won't work because y was stored
in scope x. Scope x doesn't exist anymore because now it's called s1 and s2.
           


These are not considered as bugs but a lack of implementation and described for those who will complain:

- The classparser does no macro expansion
- The widget editor does not generate geometry management implementations
- TMake is not yet supported
- If the generation of the KDE libs documentation fails, go to http://developer.kde.org or www.kdevelop.org and get the tar'ed documentation.

Install dir problem.
When creating a normal2 project (and others?) the default png files are
installed in $$(kde_xxx). The $$ is incorrect - it should be $. This also
appears to happen with old projects (pre kdevelop2.0) opened with kdevelop2.0.
The install directory in this case can be $$$$(kde_xxx)
The workaround is to remove these duplicate $'s in the properties dialog.
