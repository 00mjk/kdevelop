classparser bugs:

A couple of problems with structs

struct test
{
  int i;
  int a;
  test() : i(100), a(200) {};
  void test1()
  { 
      int ab = a;
      a = 1;
};

the constructor, test(), doesn't appear (that I can find), and test1() appears
as a "Function" not under the "Structures"/"test"


A class problem:

class test
{
  int i;
  int a;

  test3()  {  a = i;  }          // private member

public:
  test() : i(0), a(1) {};
  void test1()
  {
      int swap=i;
      i=a;
      a=swap;
  }
};

the class test appears in the class list but has no children and test(),
test1() appear as "Functions". test3() does not appear. Add "private:" before
test3() and it'll work properly,


These are not considered as bugs but a lack of implementation and described for those who will complain:

- The classparser does no macro expansion
- The widget editor does not generate geometry management implementations
- TMake is not yet supported
- KDE 2 is not supported, neither Qt 2.0. KDE 2 is in development and KDevelop will be ported after the next KDE 1.1.x release.
- If the generation of the KDE libs documentation fails, go to http://developer.kde.org or www.kdevelop.org and get the tar'ed documentation.
