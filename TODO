/- indentation
  + add a TabIndent mode (not the same thing as AutoIndent)
  - fix: leftmost { doesn't autoindent
  - undo doesn't work after indent
  - indent-region
  - indent open paren/close paren, etc.
  - indent << 
  - indent public:, ...
  - display modes in status bar
  - (maybe) a way to insert Tab when in TabIndent mode
