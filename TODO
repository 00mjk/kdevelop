* Distinguish vanilla c++ support from c++ + Qt extensions
  and show signals/slots in the class view only with Qt.

* Fix the whole mess with header files which are parsed
  whenever the source file is parsed. This is implemented
  this way because header files don't appear in _SOURCES
  in KDE projects :-(

* In subproject options dialog, implement check list with
  include directories.

* In target options dialog, implement check list with (convenience)
  libraries which can be linked with.

* Implement modification of build order.

* Change make frontend to use QTextView instead of QListBox, so
  word wrapping can be implemented.

* Perhaps use konsole part for the application frontend

* Split the documentation tree in two halves, so that class lists
  appear separately. In the current setup, one can easily get lost
  when opening a class list.

* Templates for cli programs

* Complete STL index. Preferably convert STL documentation to docbook :-)

* Implement reverse I-search

* Check if a man page exists before offering the context menu
  item 'Goto manpage'
