-----TODO list for a first beta version-------

- the editor (using kwrite part, first prototype integration is available)
- project management (most of the basics (multiple projects,appwizard,persistence...) is implemented,the makefile generation and Projectoptions aren't finished yet
- documentation browser (isn't integrated yet, should be based on khtml part)
- debugger (doesn't work)
- assorted templates (a small KDE2 is available at the moment, some more should be added. Application Wizard plugins)
- a new Real File View (small filemanager,a konqueror component?) 
- grep (works)
- make system for c++ (works)
- classparser (the current version works, but we will need a better solution in the future)	
- project view (works)
