* Distinguish vanilla c++ support from c++ + Qt extensions
  and show signals/slots in the class view only with Qt.

* Fix the whole mess with header files which are parsed
  whenever the source file is parsed. This is implemented
  this way because header files don't appear in _SOURCES
  in KDE projects :-(

* Implement modification of build order.

* Perhaps use konsole part for the application frontend

* Complete STL index. Preferably convert STL documentation to docbook :-)

* Implement reverse I-search

* Check if a man page exists before offering the context menu
  item 'Goto manpage'

* Show intro page on startup

* Optional: Arrange classes by sub project
