structure library
------------------

This library will feature QT-like (although not necessarily following all conventions of it) data structures.

I plan to invest some effort in a proper tree and graph data structure, but others are considered.
(for instance a trie code which I already have).

These data structures will be accompanied with certain higher order functions to use them
(such as traversals, etc.)

Following that, there will be visualization modules for interacting with these structures. I have not made
an exact design of that part, but I'm hoping it will be available some time in the future. This would have
to provide for automatic construction of a control widget from user supplied widgets.

NOTES:

* As geiseri suggests, QDOM already gives us a tree, but that's not what I intend to write
* I'm aware of the graph code in classview
