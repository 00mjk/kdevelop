%{APPNAME} REQUIREMENTS
------------------------

kde >= 3.2 is needed to run %{APPNAME}

To compile %{APPNAME}, the kde development packages
are needed: kdelibs-devel, kdebase-devel and python

scons is also needed http://www.scons.org
(this tool also used by Blender, ..)
Make sure scons is at least v0.96.1, otherwise
the compilation will fail. In case if you do not have
it, a minimum distribution is provided (see SCONS below)

-> One should only have to run :
$ scons
# scons install
(do "scons install" as root - the menus may not
show up if you skip this step)


SCONS
-----

-> If scons is missing, use the one bundled with PROGRAMNAME :
./unpack_local_scons.sh
python scons.py
python scons.py install
(run the last command as root)


-> For your convenience, a quick makefile is created :
./unpack_local_scons.sh
make
make install


USEFUL SCONS COMMANDS
---------------------

build the targets   : scons
install them        : scons install
clean the project   : scons -c
uninstall           : scons -c install
build in parallel   : scons -j2

CONFIGURATION NOTES
-------------------

The installation scripts are relying on the kde-config program.
The programs kde-config, qmake, uic and moc must be accesssible
through your PATH.

Qt and kde may not be installed as expected (in QTDIR and KDEDIR)
So until kde-config is able to give that information, you may
have to give those paths.

Here are some examples :
On Fedora/Redhat
   scons configure kdeincludes=/usr/include/kde/
On Debian
   scons configure qtincludes=/usr/include/qt/ kdeinclude=/usr/include/kde/
To install in some particular location with additional include paths
   scons configure prefix=~/tmp extraincludes=/tmp/include:/usr/local/include

For more options to tune the build look at the .py files available on 
the top-level directory :
generic.py, kde.py, ...

The build system is based on bksys, a build system that replaces
autoconf, automake and make in a row. Feel free to report your opinion
about it to the authors.

BUILDING RPMS OR DEBS WITH CHECKINSTALL
---------------------------------------

With checkinstall 1.6, use
$ scons
# checkinstall --fstrans=no --nodoc scons install
# scons uninstall
