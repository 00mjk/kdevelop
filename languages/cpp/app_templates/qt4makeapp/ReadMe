READ THIS IN ORDER TO COMPILE THE Qt4 TEMPLATE
----------------------------------------------

BEFORE building your project, quit KDevelop.

In a terminal (Konsole for example) set your QTDIR environment variable to point to Qt4 installation and be sure that your PATH includes the $QTDIR/bin.

For Bash users, you will do this by typing the following commands in the terminal:
export QTDIR=/path/to/qt4
export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH 

Then run KDevelop from this terminal by typing:
kdevelop &

Then Build your template using the Build menu in KDevelop.


This ensures qmake from qt4 is used to build your project.
