	* Moved the splitter widget to lib/util, so it can be shared with parts

2001-04-13  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk

	* Applied patch from Oliver Strutynski to fix bug in the Java tokenizer
	  with non US-ASCII identifiers in source files.

2001-04-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

	* Added a plugin that let's you select the parts to load
	  on startup

	* added a part to display a "Tip of the day"
	* moved over the tips from the previous HEAD branch,
	  which probably need a review

2001-04-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>

	* Rewritten the icon border stuff from 1.x for use
	  with multiple views per document
	* Ported the debugger frontend

2001-04-06  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk

	* Added Java and Objective-C class browsing, and Java KDE project template and
	automake support (ie the _JAVA primary). Fixed bug in class browser where a 
	method's arguments were not being displayed (was that a bug or a feature?). 
	Clicking on a class's instance variables in the class browser now works and 
	takes you to the source file.
