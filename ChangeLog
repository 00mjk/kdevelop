2001-07-03  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added accessor methods to the Class store/parser sources, so that
          instance variables should no longer need to be accessed directly.
          Java plugin api sources regenerated to use the new accessor method names

        * Separated project options widget in 4 separate widgets 
          instead of one tab widget and embedded them 
          into the general project options dialog. This is
          more intuitive for the user and doesn't expose
          KDevelop's internal structure so much

2001-06-12  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New part regexptest for testing regular expressions
        * Fixed make frontend to recognize ftnchek messages
          correctly
        * Changed make frontend api again so that the dir is
          given as parameter. Necessary for finding the 
          directory of an erroneous file when only one
          directory is built
        * Rerun configure when project options have changed.

2001-06-05 Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
	* Reenabled the signals when files are loaded and
          saved, so Bernd can test ;)
          (This was a hotfix, I will do the real one later)

        * New add service dialog in project management
          Not quite ready
        * Bug fixes in sub project and target options dialog

2001-06-02  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * New sub project and target options dialogs.
          These are much more user-friend wrt convenience
          libraries and include directories within the
          project. Furthermore, the libtool options are
          presented in documented check boxes
        * Put compiler options widget into the project
          options framework

2001-06-01  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>

        * Made some dom writing code more robust by
          creating non-existent nodes in the tree
        * Rewrote the import dialog to allow the choice between

2001-05-31  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added a Java JNI based plugin api, and a corresponding
          project template for building a plugin. Java parts are
          not built if a --without-java flag is used for configuration,
          or if no suitable versions of javac, jar etc are found.

2001-05-31  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a zillion other languages to ctags tag mappings
        * Regular expression matching in ctags part
        * Tell user about dot in configure

2001-05-30  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a ctags part

2001-05-30  Thomas Fromm <tf@tfromm.com>
        * Added basic Highlighting for PHP

        * Added python documentation index
        * Made file view aware of files added to and
          removed from the project

        * Fixed project management regexps for tabs
        * Fixed project management to properly emit addedFile signals
        * Fixed auto project behaviour for prefixes with underscores
        * LIBADD is for libraries, LDADD for programs
        * Implemented 'Add prefix' dialog
        * Show progress dialog when parsing files
        * Implemented Remove file dialog in project management.
          Does not quite work yet :-(

2001-05-25  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added FORTRAN 77 parser
        * Added plugins for g77 and the Portland Group's
          f77 compiler and High Performance Fortran 
          compiler driver

2001-05-24 Sandy Meier   <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * added option (load last project on startup)
        * saved mainview configuration on exit

2001-05-24  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>

          based C and C++ programs

2001-05-23  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Fixed file view and made it possible to add new
          groups and change the order of matched patterns
        * Added preliminary fortran support part with a
          ftnchek configuration dialog. Parser follows later...

2001-05-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a new part 'FileView' which shows all files of
          a project sorted in groups like 'Sources' and
          'User Interface'. The groups can be configured
          by the user. A default setting is provided by the
          application wizard.

2001-05-20 Sandy Meier   <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * added initial PHP support including a simple php parser
        * added "hello world" PHP template to AppWizard

2001-05-20  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a new editor interface for debugging
          (breakpoints etc.)
        * Added cast methods to the editor interfaces, so
          you don't have to pass strings around any longer

2001-05-19  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added kicker, kioslave and kcmodule templates
        * Each template can define an icon which is
          shown in the app wizard
        * The Big KInstance Cleanup

2001-05-19  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin to provide and configure a 
          Tools menu.

2001-05-17  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Categorized all parts into Global or Project,
          so that they are either loaded at startup or
          at project loading time
        * Added part selector which allows to configure
          the used parts both globally and on a per-
          project basis

2001-05-14  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Back to KDialogBase for configuration dialogs

2001-05-13  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added a project options dialog to which any
          plugin can add a tab.
        * Debugger configuration dialog
        * Temporarily gone back to QTabDialog for these
          configuration dialogs instead of KDialogBase.
          Not sure if this is right...

2001-05-13  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        
        * Added a status interface to the editor interfaces
        * Implemented display of editor status in the main
           statusbar

2001-05-12  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Changed compiler frontend to use QTextView, instead of QListBox.
          Now copy&paste are possible, and the view scrolls to the end of the
          output (unless the user has clicked otherwise)
        * Also fixed the shortcuts
        * Fixed buffer menu for documentation parts

2001-05-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Commited the new editor framework
          Note that it is not yet active, as it is not yet
          complete. But it is evolving...

2001-05-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added Python Hello world template
        * Fixed memory leaks
        * Fixed project files in templates to include mainprogram variable
        * Fixed script project to not show . and .. and to go to a source
          file when it is clicked
        * Implemented printing

2001-05-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented proper comparing of file identities:
          Instead of the file name, now devno/inode are compared.
          Important for NFS systems, where file names may have
          a prefix like /tmp_mnt in some occasions
          This was already implemented in the HEAD branch 
          before the old one ;-)
        * Implemented KDevCore::gotoFile() as a generic method
          to "go" to a file. Works for arbitrary mime types.
        * Implemented KDevCore::revertAllFiles()
        * Warning dialogs when modified files are closed or when
          saved/loaded files were modified outside.
        * Implemented searching html widget

2001-05-08  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Use flex instead of $(LEX)
        * Made function prototypes in tokenizer.l static.
          Not making them 'static' explicitly makes them
          'extern' and causes a conflict
        * Removed tokenizer.cpp from cvs, so it gets
          generated at build time

2001-05-05  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        
        * prepared the Tip-of-the-Day plugin to make use of the
          KTipDialog class that will soon appear in kdelibs.

2001-05-01  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Removed hard coded java classpaths, and classnames. They are derived
          from the projectDirectory and mainProgram project attributes.
        * Checked in jdb front end code from Oliver Strutynski. He comments:
          'I finished work on a first version of JDB Support. It is not at 
          all feature complete (setting breakpoints does not work yet, hangs 
          from time to time) but could serve as a starting point for further
          development. The directory contains a README describing some of the 
          parsing in the jdbcontroller.'

2001-04-29  Sandy Meier  <smeier@kdevelop.org>
        * some changes in appwizard gui (qtdesigner based),
        templates can have a category property now

2001-04-27  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Implemented a generic project part for scripting languages. 
          It essentially consists of a widget that displays all files 
          in all subdirectories.
        * Changed the class view to respect the feature set of the used 
          language. I.e. for example for python the sections with 
          variables are not displayed, as in python variables are not 
          declared.
        * Sanitized project loading: The user now chooses the project
          file in a file dialog, not the directory. The kapp, kpart 
          and kpartplugin appwizard scripts install a project file now.
        * Replaced the persistence stuff (which was not yet used) in the
          classstore with serialization routines based on QDataStream.
          In principle, we could now send them around via DCOP :-)
        * Implemented a python support part with parser
        * Implemented a perl support part with parser

2001-04-22  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Made configure arguments configurable
          Patch by Berndt Josef Wulf <wulf@dingo.ping.net.au>
        * Don't link with libfl in cppsupport and javasupport
        * Each part now uses its own instance and the corresponding
          resource directory

2001-04-18  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * GDB debugger part sources copied to 'parts/javadebugger', and all names 
          changed to JDB ones. Ready to add jdb functionality.

2001-04-17  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Moved the splitter widget to lib/util, so it can be shared with parts
        * Moved the editor part to lib/kwrite, to allow parts to access it.
        * Added astyle part, a source code reformatter.

2001-04-13  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Applied patch from Oliver Strutynski to fix bug in the Java tokenizer
          with non US-ASCII identifiers in source files.

2001-04-11  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * Added a plugin that let's you select the parts to load
          on startup
        * Added some code to core to only load the plugins selected.

2001-04-10  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Added memory view widget
        * Fixed disassemble widget to act only when it is visible
        * Added examine core file and attach to process
        * Cleaning widget after the debugger has finished
        * Added status bar text and whats this
        * Clear execution point mark when debugger has finished

2001-04-10  Matthias Hoelzer-Kluepfel <mhk@caldera.de>
        * added a part to display a "Tip of the day"
        * moved over the tips from the previous HEAD branch,
          which probably need a review

2001-04-09  Bernd Gehrmann  <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>
        * Rewritten the icon border stuff from 1.x for use
          with multiple views per document
        * Ported the debugger frontend

2001-04-06  Richard Dale <duke@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
        * Added Java and Objective-C class browsing, and Java KDE project template and
        automake support (ie the _JAVA primary). Fixed bug in class browser where a 
        method's arguments were not being displayed (was that a bug or a feature?). 
        Clicking on a class's instance variables in the class browser now works and 
        takes you to the source file.
