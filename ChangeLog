    * again synchronized with original QextMDI.
      - Should solve all focus problems, inclusively the 'disappearing editor-cursor bug'

      the QDomElement was there but didn't have a childnode
    * moved the LDFLAGS plus the commented out checkboxes to a
      seperate tab on the configuration

2001-11-21  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * applied patch of August Hrandl <august.hoerandl@gmx.at>
       it adds completion to the typename in the classproperties dialog (attributes and members)

2001-11-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bufix: showing global functions in classparser works again (fix of 2001-11-07-fix)
    * cvs version number is 2.0.3pre (we are after KDE-2.2.2 release)
    * avoids automatic resizing of VAR tree column 0. (has driven me insane)

2001-11-19  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * alphabetic sorting of folders in classview
    * folder entries in classview have deeper structure than 1 level now

2001-11-13  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * dangerous memory leak in QextMdiChildView fixed
    * no #if 0 in highlighting.cpp

2001-11-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: attributes with namespace prefix in variable type are displayed in class parser now

2001-11-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * ALT+0 till ALT+9 for all MDI modes now

2001-11-03  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: kde3: docBrowser wouldn't show url when clicking on the url
              in the browser window.

2001-11-02  Walter Tasin <tasin@kdevelop.org>
    * solving the autoconf problem
      now c/c++ templates are tested with new autoconf 2.52 version
    * c and c++ templates are using the admin directory
      (but take care a c terminal application has its own
       adapted version of some acinclude.m4 macros)
    * most project types should work with automake 1.5
      (only gnome still doesn't work)

2001-11-02  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: disable the disassemble when it's hidden
    * bugfix ;-): ALT+0 till ALT+9 switches the views in tab page mode
    * good news for the keyboard freaks! New accelerators:
      - CTRL+SHIFT+C or L or R or D or V switches_to/activates the tree tool-views
      - CTRL+SHIFT+M or O or E or K or B or F or A or G switches_to/activates the output tool-views
    * bugfix: tree views inherit KListView now --> fixed the single/double click problem (uses KDE settings now)
    * bugfix: click/return on *already-selected* tree-view item fires the selection signal as well
      --> so click on DOC-tree-->Qtlibrary always goes back again to start page (don't care if a sublink on the startpage has been clicked)

2001-11-02  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix for 27/10/2001 patch (repaired switching the files (KDE2 version))

2001-11-01  Harald Fernengel <harry@bnro.de>

2001-11-01  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * workaround for a strange behaviour of kdoc: don't try libkmid when building the API documentation of the project
      --> at least building the API docu works now again

2001-10-30  Roland Krause  <rokrau@yahoo.com>
    * Fixed compilation problems with KDE3 and Qt3

2001-10-30  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: use Unicode for LFV --> fixes character salad with non-latin strings

2001-10-29  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * syntax highlighting also for *.tlh and *.inl files
      (C++ template header and source file type)

2001-10-27  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * applied patch of John Birch (jbb@kdevelop.org) for debugging of multithreaded applications
    * as well as his bugfix for displaying Qt3 strings when "show static members" is switched on

2001-10-27  Grisha Mokhin <mokhin@bog.msu.ru>
    * applied patch of Nikita Youshchenko who fixed the incorrect display of non-latin characters in editor views

2001-10-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: don't lose the editor-view cursor when switching tool-views on and off

2001-10-22  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: don't use 'all' as parameter for the 'make' call. That's no good with Makefiles which doesn't
      have the 'all:' section but works otherwise since 'all' is default.

2001-10-15  Harald Fernengel <harry@bnro.de>
    * (hopefully) fixed the disappearing cursor bug

2001-10-15  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * kde3 compiling fixes.

2001-10-13  Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
    * fixed admin.tar.gz to HEAD with changing search path for KDE from /opt/kde3 to /opt/kde2 and
      the minimum Qt version to 2, minor version 2
    * removed EXTRA_DIST = admin from all templates' Makefile.am in the top srcdir and changed the appwizard
      to add admin to the line the wizard (and kdevelop) writes into that Makefile.am. This should fix all
      automake and autoconf problems with newer versions. Additionally, the qt/embedded check is in HEAD which
      should enable all templates to work with qt/e now.

2001-10-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * version number is 2.0.2 (now with KDE-2.2.2 insight)

2001-09-29  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * more porting to KDE3
     (worked around a Qt-3 0x0 crash bug that will be fixed in the next Qt version)

2001-09-26  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * ported to Qt3 except kdevelop's output view

2001-08-29  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * changed version number to 2.0.1

2001-08-27  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * avoid khtml crash on restoring files also with KDE-2.2.0

2001-08-26  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * find dialog in docu view highlights found text piece again
      (solution: uses KHTMLPart's find dialog now)
    * fixed the "collapsing tree view" bug for class view (CV) and real file view (RFV)
    * consider hint of Simon Hausmann to let tokenizer.cc compile with gcc3

2001-08-23  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * pop up normal search dialog if user presses "Find again" without specifying a search string before
    * hopefully fixed the "I can't close any windows anymore" bug

2001-08-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: 0x0 access in DocViewMan::doSwitchToFile

2001-08-12  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * bugfix: removed obsolete library check

2001-08-08  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * bugfix: fixed another one of these fucking 0x0 pointer segfaults,
      this time too late for KDE-2.2.... shit

2001-08-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: last fix concerning a grave GUI bug, was application crash in Toplevel mode
              (clicked Compile when no view of two was activated)

2001-08-04  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Bring admin dir upto kde-2.2_release
    * workaround: bug#30097 frank assured me that KDEHOME was not set, but .kde2 was
      being used. This change just prefers .kde2 over .kde iff KDEHOME is not set.
      It shouldn't hurt and I gave kdevelop-devel a day to complain ...

2001-07-31  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * cut/paste for non-source files
    * made it compile with gcc-3.0, too

2001-07-30  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: The order of Toplevel and Childframe mode were mixed up
    * bugfix: delete the [dock_setting_default] section
              before starting kdevelop for the first time
              (hint of Waldo Bastian, after message freeze we could provide an
              appropriate reset button in the GUI)
    * added Lars Beikirch's <Lars.Beikirch@gmx.net> patch for QextMDI
      concerning min/max sizes of childviews and maximized Childframe mode
      (related to QextMDI but not to KDevelop)
    * probably last bugfix before the KDE-2.2 tag: the legendary "Bero-crash"
      --> now we use another config file section for the docking state in KDevelop-2.0
    * added kdevelop/kdevelop/tools/kdevelop2.upd that will be installed in
      $(kde_datadir)/kconf_update. After the first "make install" or first restart
      of KDE the evil section [dock_setting_default] will be removed from CVS

2001-07-29  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: debugging with Toplevel MDI mode works properly now
      (focus problem in QextMDI and DocViewMan::doSwitchToFile fixed)
    * some debug messages removed

2001-07-26  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: save MDI mode to config only when leaving the program
      (fixes problems with several opened KDevelops opened/closed in parallel)
    * applied patch of Lars Beikirch <Lars.Beikirch@gmx.net> for QextMDI concerning some
      internal mechanisms, e.g. reduces view-switch flickering

2001-07-26  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * bugfix: F12 without having Project loaded, 2nd attempt

2001-07-26  John Firebaugh <jfirebaugh@kde.org>
    * Bug fix for the creation of ctags database.
      Developer's Note: The following is not a good thing to do:
      QStringList::Iterator it = methodThatReturnsQStringListByValue().begin();
      Why? As soon as that statement is executed, the temorary QStringList is
      destructed and your iterator is left pointing somewhere bad. A very
      tricky thing!

2001-07-26  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * KDE version check fixed. Now KDevelop-2.0 runs even on FreeBSD
      with the little help of KrazyKiwi. Thanks a lot!
    * applied patch of John Firebaugh <jfirebaugh@kde.org>. Thanks a lot!
    * bugfix: repaired Project->Rebuild, Project->DistClean/RebuildAll and
      optimized CKDevelop::slotProcessExited, needs to be tested a while
    * QextMDI: replaced a focus-problem mega-hack (inherits('QDialog') etc.) by a neat solution

2001-07-25  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * bugfix: F12 now works without a project loaded. I've implemented this
      somewhat reluctantly, it should work but KDevelop should be used with
      a project in general. It is not really intended as a file editor.

2001-07-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: memory leaks were detected in QextMDI by Purify
    * bugfix: completed Harald's bugfix concerning the view state problem
       (some problems happened in Toplevel MDI mode)

2001-07-24  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * fix: Save-Button is now enabled when current document gets changed
    * fix: KDevelop now opens project files that come in as URL from konqueror (ignores the "file:")

2001-07-23  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * fix: Wheelmouse works now fine after reaching top or bottom of document

2001-07-23  Eray Ozkural (exa) <erayo@cs.bilkent.edu.tr>
    * improved debian packaging (see debian changelog)
    * fix: bool bug in setup that prevented finding KDE docs in KDELIBS_DOCDIR

2001-07-23  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * fix: one NULL pointer crash in docviewman
    * several enhancements to the ctags browse implementation
      - fixed crashes when no ctags program was found or tagging failed
      - fixed reloading of the tags database
      - changed ctags commandline parameters to minimize problems with older
        versions of ctags
      - now all source files under the current directory are tagged

2001-07-23  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * speed up KWriteView by avoiding unnecessary focusInEvent processing
    * focus problem of Toplevel MDI mode hopefully solved
      (never set the focus to another widget when a closeView is pending!, it confuses the DocViewMan)
    * some speed optimization in QextMDI

2001-07-22  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * several bugfixes concerning the Toplevel MDI mode
    * hopefully fixed the setMainCaption crash bug

2001-07-21  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * big bugfix: accelerators for undocked MDI views work again! :-)
      --> Toplevel MDI mode is really ready to use now
    * bugfixes: focus problems with undocked views
      (Thanks to QextMDI guru Lars Beikirch!)
    * bugfix: system menu of maximized view (in Childframe mode)

2001-07-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: disassemble tool-view works again
    * bugfix: frame stack tool-view on/off-switch fixed

2001-07-17  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * reverted Harald's patch because of the message and feature freeze (Ralf's wish is my comand ;)
    * bugfix: step 3 to enable the restoring of the GUI also in TabPage MDI mode. Hopefully finished.
      ==> that's why: writeDockConfig() re-enabled, KDevelop saves dock szenario to kdeveloprc file again.
    Attention:
      In case of a messed up dock state, please, remove section [dock_setting_default] from $HOME/.kde/share/config/kdeveloprc!
    * default size if we start for the first time
    * code cleanup (KDE_2_1_1 and QTPRINTER stuff removed)

2001-07-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * some bugfixes in QextMDI (synchronized with Dr. Baldeweg AG sources of original QextMDI)

2001-07-11  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * added File->Revert Menu Entry to revert changes and reload file from disk

2001-07-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: show/hide mechanism of MDI-view taskbar fixed
      (I had also to fix kdelibs/kdeui/ktoolbar.cpp, Please update!)
    * for the haters of delayed startlogos:
      mouse click on startlogo hides it when mainwindow is already visible

2001-07-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: setFocus problem with inner widgets of a QextMdiChildView's focus loop fixed
      --> blinking cursor appears again when switching to files!
    * bugfix: some minor focus probs with QextMDI
    * bugfix: doubleclick on GrepView entry lets cursor blink again in target code line.
      Fuckin' hell, I've missed that so much...
    * don't blindly open everything with KRun in CKDevelop::switchToFile, ask if it's xpm,
      hmm....need some more types to be checked?
    * setup wizared: syntax highlighting for .moc, .diff and .po files added
    * applied patch of Andre Bell <andre.bell@gmx.de> (docu tree works even if no project is loaded)

2001-07-09  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: strange dock-back effect fixed
    * bugfix: bugreport of rokrau: ''2 Undesired switch between RFV and CV... fixed.
    * bugreport of rokrau: '1 When closing a file, more than the one active file is
      closed...tabbed MDI mode...' hopefully fixed.
    * applied patch of Lorenzo Delana <ldelana@libero.it> (automake dir var name)
      Thanks a lot, Lorenzo!

2001-07-09  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Fix a null pointer crash in main.cpp. I cant leave you guys alone for
      a single week, can I? :-)

2001-07-07  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Added qt3 string support

2001-07-04  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * step 2 to enable the restoring of the GUI also in TabPage MDI mode:
        I splitted the loading of project in 2 parts because it must call readDockConfig()
        after the loading of .kdevses but before the loading of .kdevprj
      ...to be continued...
    * added Carsten Wolff <AirWulf666@gmx.net> to Authors (who patched the toolbutton states)
      Thanks a lot.

2001-07-01  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: initial toolbutton state fixed
    * bugfix: prevented startup from flickering
    * bugfix: readDockConfig() is still disabled since there are cases in tab MDI mode
              when it screws up the user interface. But I already fixed it for Childframe MDI mode today.

2001-07-01  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * startlogo solution of gallium reactivated plus a little change by me
      (now it as cool as Gallium programmed it but acts as Ralf wanted it to be.
       Additionally, one can click it away to background if he dislikes it)
      and the code doesn't bother huge class CKDevelop any more
    * some code cleanup
    * part 1 of fixing the treeviews/outputviews toolbutton state, not finished yet
    * removed very annoying query-message "KDevelop was not shutdown correctly. Would you like..."
      Sometimes it was OK, but most of the time it was not. E.g. if you started a second KDevelop.
      Now it doesn't ask but simply avoids loading the project.
    * removed loading/saving of tool-view states to the project file
      (this is already done by read/writeDockState, and always made conflicts when having a .kdevprj in CVS.

2001-06-29  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Fixed a seg fault in treehandler when clicking on class icon.
    * Fixed kdevprj.save to reflect the correct location of ctoolclass.*.

2001-06-29  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: tools menu was built incorrectly - the label and exe were
    * inadvertantly swapped.
    * allowed full path name to be given for tool program whilst I was there.
    * removed ctoolclass.cpp and h from setup dir - now we just have one copy
    * in kdevelop dir. Lots of things use it ...
    * fixed crash in kdevelop when no project but window title code wanted the
    * prj. It was difficult to repeat. (read I couldn't...)

2001-06-27  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix in QextMDI: call base class method in ::focusInEvent(), otherwise focus problems can occur
      (bugfix supplied by Peter Zimmermann <peter.zimmermann@dr-baldeweg.de>)
    * 0x0 access crash avoided in CKDevelop::slotProcessExited, actual reason lies deeper in the mechanism though

2001-06-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * Now Options->Editor... also works without opened views
    * minor changes in QextMDI

2001-06-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: optimize options where never defaulting quite correctly
    * so I fixed and disabled the options for optimize and debug if they
    * wern't checked.
    * Removed print from project files - it's not compiled anymore
    * bugfix: added $LEXLIB to _project_ file so that regenerating the makefiles
    * works again - I don't understand why that is so hard to do :)
    * bugfix: Reverted Harry's debug fix for Qt3.x strings. it didn't always
    * work - needs more thought, Harry :)

2001-06-22  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
   * fixed bug when file was modified outside editor
   * KDevelop can now debug Qt 3.x strings too.

2001-06-21  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
   * finished the redesign of the KDevelop setup by a QWizard
   * I noticed htdig hasn't got a htdig.conf file in the KDevelop installation
     But how is it supposed to work then?

2001-06-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
   * revised view focus/activation handling:
     Now QextMdiChildView seems to emit the activated(this) signal properly
     (not too less and not too often)
   * synchronized with QextMDI CVS version of Dr. Baldeweg AG Dresden
     - signal gotFocus(..) is renamed to activated(..) now!
     - doubleclick on icon button closes view
     - caption and icon for undocked views,
     - some nice little helper functionality in the classes
     - 'Tile Pragma' repaired
     - revised 'Windows' menu
   * DocViewMan adapted to that new QextMDI API

2001-06-18  rokrau@yahoo.com
   * bugfix: KDevelop's treeviews now respect the user setting for
     single/double clicks. For this I had to change part of ctreeview
     and also connect TreeView slots to KListView signals executed() and
     contextMenu(). This may have introduced some other problems, please
     test and report.

2001-06-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
   * further work on kdevelop/setup (indexing, changed text, related bugfixes)

   * bugfix: prevent an infinite loop in coutputwidget.cpp

2001-06-12  rokrau@yahoo.com
   * bugfix: kdevelop didnt open a project from the command line, instead
     dumped core
   * bugfix: SIGSEV when closing a document, sometimes...
   * cleanup: removed some functions that are not called any longer

2001-06-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
   * splitted setup/ckdevinstall.h in several headers, more bugfixes for libkdevelopsetup.so
   * activated fixed creation of kdelibs docu and indexing of docu again

     the file.

2001-06-08  rokrau@yahoo.com
   * disabled tip.h and related code if USE_KDE_2_1_1 is set, allow cut and
     paste for Fortran sources and added an assert for a suspected SIGSEV
     crash

2001-06-06  Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
   * restored the spashlogo as it was before. Now it shows all of the time
      the last project is loaded which can take a while ad which is why it worked
      the former way :)
   * removed the KTipOfDay class and dialog. Were using KTipDialog from kdelibs now :)
      tip.database changed to XML accordingly.

2001-06-06  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Moved some slots from the CKDevelop class to DocViewMan.
    * New signal in DocViewMan to change the status message.

2001-06-05  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * initially added new setup wizard (as shared library),
      it is a quite redesigned setup app based on Ralf's old sources but now based on QWizard,
      still unfinished and we need cool pictures for each page

2001-06-04  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * Added option to switch off bracket highlighting

2001-06-04  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: crash when typing F4 on empty project

2001-06-02  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * some minor reorganization of the ctags code and a little enhancement
      so that not only cpp files but also cxx files are found in header/source
      switching

2001-06-01  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Patch from August Hrandl <august.hoerandl@gmx.at>
        just a little "adjustment" to the clone functionalities "templates"
        - added the copy constructor
        - corrected operator << and >>

2001-06-01  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * initial Fortran support, Fortran files are recognized as source files
      instead of data files and they can be compiled
    * switch between source and header files now works also without ctags
      support. This is slower but shouldn't be noticable for smaller projects.
    * the methods CKDevelop::readProperties and CKDevelop::saveProperties are,
      as it seems, not called from anywhere anymore, so I commented them out.
      This marks them for deletion in the next code cleanup.
    * improved the implementation of the CTags support a little bit.

2001-06-01  Harald Fernengel  <harry@bnro.de>
    * added parenthesis highlighting code (stole it from quanta, so if it isn't working
      please don't blame me ;). Very primitive, works only for () [] and {}

2001-05-30  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: focus problems when starting KDevelop in TabPage mode
    * bugfix: 0L access crash in DocViewMan::slot_gotFocus (reported by Peter Zimmermann)

    * Improved a little code bookmarks.

2001-05-28  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * TabPage MDI mode ready to use now, please test it!
    * better icons for the views

2001-05-27  Harald Fernengel <harry@bnro.de>
    * bugfix: Tools-dialog got into an endless loop if all tools were deleted

2001-05-27  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * further work on TabPage mode, (land in sight!) ;
    * File->Close(), Window->Close(), Window->CloseAll() fixed,
      DocViewMan improved therefore, should better consider outside/inside changes now

2001-05-26  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * further work on TabPage MDI mode
    * bugfix: 0L pointer accesses in kwrite lib fixed (important for TabPage mode session loading)

2001-05-24  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: solved event timing problem with KDE's window manager on a flood of mixed show, hide and reparent events on app startup
              --> now we hide the main widget until readDockConfig has finished
              (you need to update your libkdeui.so (of kdelibs) to tonight's version, too!)
    * switch between TabPage mode and Childframe mode works properly now

2001-05-22  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: backswitch from Toplevel mode to Childframe mode works properly now
    * --> that's why: enabled readDockConfig() in CKDevelop constructor again

2001-05-22  Harald Fernengel <harry@bnro.de>
    * Added 2 slots activateNextWin() and activatePrevWin() to QextMdiMainFrm.
    * Added 2 new keyboard accels: "Goto Next Window" and "Goto Previous Window"
      to easily cycle through the open windows.
      default-keys: Alt-PgUp and Alt-PgDown

2001-05-19  Harald Fernengel <harry@bnro.de>
    * Added support for events. Define them in "eventsrc" and fire them via
      KNotifyClient::event(). Currently we have two events: "BuildSuccess" and
      "BuildError".

2001-05-19  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * fixed focus problems introduced with the bugfixes on 2001-05-18

2001-05-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * prevent a gotFocus() signal in QextMdiChildView's activate(). Hope that helps... ;
    * bugfix: reverted the change for setGeometry(..) called in QextMdiChildFrm::setState(), it didn't work ;
    * applied patch for QextMDI by Lars Beikirch (lars.beikirch@gmx.net) to make a better fix for the
      QEvent::ChildInserted/ChildRemoved problem with messageboxes and modal dialogs

2001-05-17  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * probably the bugfix for the 'popupmenu speed drop' problem

2001-05-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * evil hack in KDevSession to get rid of the event timing problem
      when adding a flood of new views to MDI
    * bugfix: set correct position of system popupmenu of MDI child view

2001-05-16  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Move the browser bookmark stuff from ckdevelop to docviewman.
    * Rename some browser bookmark methods.
    * Rename some browser bookmark attributes in docviewman.
    * Improve browser bookmark popup menu.

2001-05-15  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: statusbar resize in case of looong texts doesn't happen any more
      (Sorry, it wasn't in KStatusBar but in KDevelop's m_statusLabel)
    * mispelled word 'documenation' fixed

2001-05-14  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Check whether the CTags program is installed.
    * Check whether the user even wants to use the CTags search database.
      This can now be set in the Options->KDevelop Setup dialog.
    * Removed Make Tags option, this is now automatic, if the file
      isnt there, it is created upon loading the tags file.
    * Made the creation and loading of the CTags database a "blocking"
      process.
    * Finally, if the user want to use CTags the database is
      now loaded when the Project is opened.

2001-05-14  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix in QextMDI: consider a messagebox with parent==this isn't a real child widget :-/
      Don't insert it in the emulated internal MDI-view focus-loop.

2001-05-12  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Update: The functionality of the CTags search implementation is
      being concentrated in an implementation class so it can later
      be made into a plugin.
    * Bugfix: F12 now leaves the cursor where it was if the file was opened.

2001-05-11  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Patch from August Hrandl <august.hoerandl@gmx.at>
      updates clone dialog
    * remove warnings from code

2001-05-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * new feature: now cursor positions in views are saved/restored to/from .kdevses-Session

2001-05-11  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Replace the CMakeOuputWidget with one derived from
      qmultilineedit. Hmmm - haven't we been here before? Wel
      not quite this does more than the old qmultilineedit widget
      and is faster than the qlistview approach.

2001-05-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: if a file is changed outside the application,
      it will now be noticed with focus change
    * bugfix: removing a file from RFV or LFV should remove the views as well now
    * bugfix: closing a view checks if the file is modified, appropriate dialogs appear

2001-05-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * made application accelerators work also for the Toplevel MDI mode
      which is needed for usuability.
    * bugfix: crash on Ctrl+f when no view was open

2001-05-09  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * some bugfixes in QextMDI for the view focus change in Toplevel MDI mode

2001-05-09  Ralf Nolden <nolden@kde.org>
    * fixed up the kcmodule errors, works now. TODO would be the binary
    (standalone) and the desktop file but I think the users will find out
    about that themselves.

2001-05-08  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * added F12 for switch to header/source
    * added Edit menu entries for CTags related functionality

2001-05-07  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: prevented annoying undock of output tool-views when calling Make or Run
    * bugfix: prevented annoying switch to class_tree tool-view when stepping through code with the internal debugger
              or opening a function subtree in VAR tool-view

2001-05-06  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: annoying question 'changed outside the editor. Wanna save?'
      although not changed is removed now.

      grepdialog.

2001-05-03  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bad behaviour fixed: avoid flickering when adding new maximized MDI views to the MDI system
    * bugfix: proper reinsertion of items in mainframe's fillWindowMenu()

      (Note: requires latest KDE version from cvs!)

2001-04-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: there was a bloody event cycle in layoutTaskBar()

2001-04-21  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * I have the first "working" draft of ctags support done now.
      It's still mostly a proof of concept but I will polish it a bit
      over time now. Select an include file and RMC will let you
      open the file through its location in the tags file.

2001-04-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: crash at Windows->CloseAll+Windows->Close

    * improved Options->KDevelop->User_interface page

2001-04-18  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>

2001-04-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * moved the MDI mode selection to Options->KDevelop->user_interface
    * bugfix: concerning the visibility of the MDI view taskbar

2001-04-17  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * likely the bugfix for the crash when closing an MDI view

2001-04-16  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Added preliminary ctags support, not functional yet but good enough
      for benchmarking.

2001-04-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * supported set/get the setting if the mainframe is in 'maximized Childframe mode'
      added loading of that in CKDevelop::readOptions()

2001-04-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: switching in View->Tab_Text works again but not completely right, use latest KDE sources from HEAD (12/04/2001)

2001-04-10  rokrau@yahoo.com

    * some small changes that should make analysing print problems easier,
      e.g. printing is handled by its own KShellProcess now.

2001-04-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * splitted tree tab view and output tab view into single tool views. Still unfinished, but ready to play with it.
      (It's a trial. If that is too complex, maybe we could replace it by the old version again later. I hope we needn't to do that.)

2001-04-08  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * added MDI-view taskbar entry to "View" menu, actually it should work but it doesn't yet. :-( That taskbar problem will tear me down 6 foot deep...

2001-04-07  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Fix a bug due to the last modified attribute of the kwritedoc not
    initialised. When we create a kwritedoc, now we check if the file exists
    and if this is true the we set the last modified date.

2001-04-08  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Add manpage display to menu

2001-04-07  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: ignore queryClose() and queryExit() at application startup time (which actually belongs to the
      closing of the KMessageBox widget), this also speeds up the startup of KDevelop because we don't save the
      whole program state to KConfig any more which is useless. And this seems to fix the problem with saving
      toolbar states (QextMdiTaskBar) that aint already processed but are only pending in this moment.
    * bugfix: added missing flag WDestructiveClose in the QextMdiMainFrm constructor
    * bugfix: remove the according MDI covers from their control list when closing views

2001-04-07  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Clean the DocViewManager class.

    *               Daniel Engelschalt <s2697@htw-dresden.de>

2001-03-31  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * cleaned up a little bit
    * 0L pointer checks for m_docViewManager->currentEditView() added in many slots
    * HTML docu views are saved/load to/from .kdevses
    * bugfix: in doCloseAllDocs(): iterator got confused because of removing a doc reference from the doc list

2001-03-30  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * implemented KDevelop's XML-based session loading&saving (currently MDI stuff, only) in a *.kdevses file
    * why? Answer: To separate stuff from the project which causes CVS merge conflicts when working in teams
    * therefore is class KDevSession now
    * it's not finished yet for docu stuff, but works for KWriteDocs and CEditViews
    * TODO: session of mainframe window and geometry of trees and output widgets

2001-03-29  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Improved struct handling in class parser from
    *               Daniel Engelschalt <s2697@htw-dresden.de>
    * use $(LIB_QT) $(LIB_KDECORE) etc where appropriate

2001-03-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: repaired design mistake in rewritten DocViewMan: KWrite docs can have several views, consider that at closing
    * that's why I added 2 methods KWriteDoc::viewCount() and KWriteDoc::viewList()

2001-03-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: CKDevelop::doActivateView() removed; QWidget::setFocus() does the job ;)

2001-03-25  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Bid rewrite if the DocViewManager stuff.
    * Removed the TEditInfo and DocViewNode structs.

    * Added: Instanciate new static attributes in cpp file.
    * Added: New feature: Read-Write property for new attribute and
             Automaticly implement properties methods in cpp file.
    * Fixed: Disabled unused undo button in Classproperties dialog
             - No code yet for it...

2001-03-21  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Crash when right click on empty space in watch window.

2001-03-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * So this is real MDI now. Create new views for the current document
      using "Window-->New Window"!
    * applied bugfixes of Roland Krause <rokrau@yahoo.com>. Thanks a lot, Roland!

2001-03-19  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * adapted HTML browser to DocViewMan MDI-mechanism
      (E.g. removed browser_widget and replaced it with m_docViewManager->currentBrowserDoc())

2001-03-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>

    * bugfix: possible crash in KWriteDoc::currentColumn(..)

2001-03-18  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Moved all the edit_info stuff from the CKDevelop class to the
      DocViewMan class.
    * Code simplified in many places in ckdevelop files.

2001-03-17  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Re-write message_widget to have coloured error messages - removed
    * cerrormessageparser.cpp .h

2001-03-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: added focusNextPrevChild(..) to avoid a focusOut, this enables the Tab key again, switched off subwidget focus loop
    * bugfix: CKDevelop::slotFileSaveAll doesn't crash any more

2001-03-17  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * add dialog for library settings - it's a bit crude :(

2001-03-16  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * global bookmarks, there are still bugs and the implementation
      will probably change.

2001-03-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * Closing and reopen edit files should work now without crash.
    * There were bugs in the DocViewMan...

2001-03-14  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * now QextMDI can look like an SDI application! :-)  (the 4. MDI mode we have got)
    * new QextMdiChildView constructor added (by Eva Brucherseifer, Thanks!)
    * some 0L pointer access bugfixes
    * bugfix: raise on click works now also for afterwards inserted child widgets
    * setPixmap in childview calls setPixmap in childframe as expected
    * taskbar button count == 0L works properly now

2001-03-14  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * got rid of s_tab_view, DocViewMan::currentDocType() added and used
    * some bugfixes (Roland Krause's crash on startup as well)
    * switch of tree views adapted

2001-03-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfixes: crash on exit (wrong type casts, forgot to remove browser view from MDI control)

2001-03-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * further work on MDI, some connect()s from init...() moved to DocViewMan::createView()
    * some bugfixes in the DocViewMan

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * clearBookmarks() is a KWriteDoc method now, KWrite::clearBookmark() just calls its KWriteDoc
    * KWriteDoc: setFileName(), setModified(), setText(), isModified() is public now (for direct access of the document (documents are the central place in an MDI architecture))
    * architecture changed in a way that cpp_widget and header_widget is away now, use CKDevelop::m_docViewManager for those things now

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * DocViewMan bugfixes
    * adapted these CKDevelop slots: slotOptionsEditor, slotOptionsEditorColors, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlightingDefaults, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlighting

2001-03-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * DocViewMan improved (set/get current doc and view, delete views)
    * replaced all edit_widget in CKDevelop by m_docViewManager->currentEditView()
    * other MDI stuff

2001-03-07  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * add sharedlib_rootname and sharedlib_LDFLAGS to project file. These can
      be set against each sharedlib, which allows us to use kdevelop to
      regenerate the Makefile.am for kdevelop.
      Regenerate the Makefile.ams and restore the project file.
      Add Roland's buildmake patch. This tidies up the buildmake process a good
      deal.

2001-03-06  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * initial code for QextMDI-based MDI feature added:
        - The DocViewMan is the MDI manager which is responsible for creating documents and multiple views on such documents ;
        - CKDevelop::initView() adapted
        - CKDevelop::switchToFile(..) adapted
        - CEditWidget adapted a little bit, some methods are public now in KWriteDoc, KWriteView and KWrite
    * the whole thing is very unusable, I just give other developers the chance to contribute, stay tuned for further development...

2001-03-06  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Dirs containing "++" would cause kimport to fail.

2001-02-26  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Window placement at startup was wrong
             Screen width missed iconBorder width adjustment.
             patch Jens Zurheide <jens.zurheide@gmx.de>

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: CPrint dialog had problems with null params.
             based on patch from
             Ravikiran Rajagopal <ravi@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu>

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Creating a cpp project didn't work.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: kimport was run directly requiring perl to be in
      /usr/bin. This was incorrect. When this failed it revealed
      a crash in the classparser which should not be called if
      reading the project files failed.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Remove restriction on version numbers

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: after a distclean if the qt dir wasn't entered then the
      configure args ended up being "--with-qt-dir= ". This failed the
      qt configure test.

2001-02-23  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed Multiple tools beng started after adding a tool
      grep support for Solaris - find params needed adjusting
      Update of QExtMDI template.

2001-02-20ish
    * kdevelop1.4 tagged for release as KDE_2_1_RELEASE. If you
      want bug fixes and other small enhancements then continue to
      extract kdevelop using the branch of KDEVELOP_1_4.

2000-12-30  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Ported 1.3 to kde2 - This is an interim version that
      allows users to do away with kde1 whilst kdevelop2.0 is
      being developed.
