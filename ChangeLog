	* Added Java and Objective-C class browsing, and Java KDE project template and
	automake support (ie the _JAVA primary). Fixed bug in class browser where a 
	method's arguments were not being displayed (was that a bug or a feature?). 
	Clicking on a class's instance variables in the class browser now works and 
	takes you to the source file.
