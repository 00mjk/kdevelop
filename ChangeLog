    * further work on MDI, some connect()s from init...() moved to DocViewMan::createView()
    * some bugfixes in the DocViewMan

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * clearBookmarks() is a KWriteDoc method now, KWrite::clearBookmark() just calls its KWriteDoc
    * KWriteDoc: setFileName(), setModified(), setText(), isModified() is public now (for direct access of the document (documents are the central place in an MDI architecture))
    * architecture changed in a way that cpp_widget and header_widget is away now, use CKDevelop::m_docViewManager for those things now

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * DocViewMan bugfixes
    * adapted these CKDevelop slots: slotOptionsEditor, slotOptionsEditorColors, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlightingDefaults, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlighting

2001-03-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * DocViewMan improved (set/get current doc and view, delete views)
    * replaced all edit_widget in CKDevelop by m_docViewManager->currentEditView()
    * other MDI stuff

2001-03-07  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * add sharedlib_rootname and sharedlib_LDFLAGS to project file. These can
      be set against each sharedlib, which allows us to use kdevelop to
      regenerate the Makefile.am for kdevelop.
      Regenerate the Makefile.ams and restore the project file.
      Add Roland's buildmake patch. This tidies up the buildmake process a good
      deal.
      
2001-03-06  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * initial code for QextMDI-based MDI feature added:
        - The DocViewMan is the MDI manager which is responsible for creating documents and multiple views on such documents ;
        - CKDevelop::initView() adapted
        - CKDevelop::switchToFile(..) adapted
        - CEditWidget adapted a little bit, some methods are public now in KWriteDoc, KWriteView and KWrite
    * the whole thing is very unusable, I just give other developers the chance to contribute, stay tuned for further development...

2001-03-06  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Dirs containing "++" would cause kimport to fail.

2001-02-26  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Window placement at startup was wrong
             Screen width missed iconBorder width adjustment.
             patch Jens Zurheide <jens.zurheide@gmx.de>

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: CPrint dialog had problems with null params.
             based on patch from 
             Ravikiran Rajagopal <ravi@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu> 

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Creating a cpp project didn't work.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: kimport was run directly requiring perl to be in
      /usr/bin. This was incorrect. When this failed it revealed
      a crash in the classparser which should not be called if
      reading the project files failed.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Remove restriction on version numbers

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: after a distclean if the qt dir wasn't entered then the
      configure args ended up being "--with-qt-dir= ". This failed the
      qt configure test.

2001-02-23  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed Multiple tools beng started after adding a tool
      grep support for Solaris - find params needed adjusting
      Update of QExtMDI template.

2001-02-20ish
    * kdevelop1.4 tagged for release as KDE_2_1_RELEASE. If you 
      want bug fixes and other small enhancements then continue to
      extract kdevelop using the branch of KDEVELOP_1_4.

2000-12-30  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Ported 1.3 to kde2 - This is an interim version that
      allows users to do away with kde1 whilst kdevelop2.0 is
      being developed.
