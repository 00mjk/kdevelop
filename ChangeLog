2001-04-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: there was a bloody event cycle in layoutTaskBar()

2001-04-21  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * I have the first "working" draft of ctags support done now.
      It's still mostly a proof of concept but I will polish it a bit
      over time now. Select an include file and RMC will let you
      open the file through its location in the tags file.

2001-04-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: crash at Windows->CloseAll+Windows->Close
    * nice icon for the MDI views
    * 2 steps of reactivating the trees-on/off button - now for a compound group of dockwidgets

2001-04-19  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * improved Options->KDevelop->User_interface page

2001-04-18  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>

    * some more integration work on the ctags support

2001-04-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * moved the MDI mode selection to Options->KDevelop->user_interface
    * bugfix: concerning the visibility of the MDI view taskbar

2001-04-17  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * likely the bugfix for the crash when closing an MDI view

2001-04-16  rokrau@yahoo.com
    * Added preliminary ctags support, not functional yet but good enough 
      for benchmarking.

2001-04-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * supported set/get the setting if the mainframe is in 'maximized Childframe mode'
      added loading of that in CKDevelop::readOptions()

2001-04-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: switching in View->Tab_Text works again but not completely right, use latest KDE sources from HEAD (12/04/2001)

2001-04-10  rokrau@yahoo.com

    * some small changes that should make analysing print problems easier,
      e.g. printing is handled by its own KShellProcess now.

2001-04-10  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * splitted tree tab view and output tab view into single tool views. Still unfinished, but ready to play with it.
      (It's a trial. If that is too complex, maybe we could replace it by the old version again later. I hope we needn't to do that.)

2001-04-08  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * added MDI-view taskbar entry to "View" menu, actually it should work but it doesn't yet. :-( That taskbar problem will tear me down 6 foot deep...

2001-04-07  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Fix a bug due to the last modified attribute of the kwritedoc not
    initialised. When we create a kwritedoc, now we check if the file exists
    and if this is true the we set the last modified date.

2001-04-08  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Add manpage display to menu

2001-04-07  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: ignore queryClose() and queryExit() at application startup time (which actually belongs to the
      closing of the KMessageBox widget), this also speeds up the startup of KDevelop because we don't save the
      whole program state to KConfig any more which is useless. And this seems to fix the problem with saving
      toolbar states (QextMdiTaskBar) that aint already processed but are only pending in this moment.
    * bugfix: added missing flag WDestructiveClose in the QextMdiMainFrm constructor
    * bugfix: remove the according MDI covers from their control list when closing views

2001-04-07  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Clean the DocViewManager class.

2001-04-06  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Add manpage display

2001-04-04  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * More improvements in class parser (handle throw() better) from
    *               Daniel Engelschalt <s2697@htw-dresden.de>

2001-03-31  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * cleaned up a little bit
    * 0L pointer checks for m_docViewManager->currentEditView() added in many slots
    * HTML docu views are saved/load to/from .kdevses
    * bugfix: in doCloseAllDocs(): iterator got confused because of removing a doc reference from the doc list

2001-03-30  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * implemented KDevelop's XML-based session loading&saving (currently MDI stuff, only) in a *.kdevses file
    * why? Answer: To separate stuff from the project which causes CVS merge conflicts when working in teams
    * therefore is class KDevSession now
    * it's not finished yet for docu stuff, but works for KWriteDocs and CEditViews
    * TODO: session of mainframe window and geometry of trees and output widgets

2001-03-29  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Improved struct handling in class parser from
    *               Daniel Engelschalt <s2697@htw-dresden.de>
    * use $(LIB_QT) $(LIB_KDECORE) etc where appropriate

2001-03-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: repaired design mistake in rewritten DocViewMan: KWrite docs can have several views, consider that at closing
    * that's why I added 2 methods KWriteDoc::viewCount() and KWriteDoc::viewList()

2001-03-25  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: CKDevelop::doActivateView() removed; QWidget::setFocus() does the job ;)

2001-03-25  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Bid rewrite if the DocViewManager stuff.
    * Removed the TEditInfo and DocViewNode structs.

2001-03-11  bretzel <serge.lussier@videotron.ca>
    * Added: Instanciate new static attributes in cpp file.
    * Added: New feature: Read-Write property for new attribute and
             Automaticly implement properties methods in cpp file.
    * Fixed: Disabled unused undo button in Classproperties dialog
             - No code yet for it...

2001-03-21  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Crash when right click on empty space in watch window.

2001-03-20  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * So this is real MDI now. Create new views for the current document
      using "Window-->New Window"!
    * applied bugfixes of Roland Krause <rokrau@yahoo.com>. Thanks a lot, Roland!

2001-03-19  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * adapted HTML browser to DocViewMan MDI-mechanism
      (E.g. removed browser_widget and replaced it with m_docViewManager->currentBrowserDoc())

2001-03-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: switched off automatic focus - wtf, (removed enterEvent() from CEditWidget)

2001-03-18  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Fix a bug (in switchToFile) in the change I previously commited.
    * Fix some bookmark bugs.

2001-03-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * applied overridden bugfix again: DocViewMan::slotFileSaveAll doesn't crash any more
    * bugfix: possible crash in KWriteDoc::currentColumn(..)

2001-03-18  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * Moved all the edit_info stuff from the CKDevelop class to the
      DocViewMan class.
    * Code simplified in many places in ckdevelop files.

2001-03-17  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Re-write message_widget to have coloured error messages - removed
    * cerrormessageparser.cpp .h

2001-03-18  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfix: added focusNextPrevChild(..) to avoid a focusOut, this enables the Tab key again, switched off subwidget focus loop
    * bugfix: CKDevelop::slotFileSaveAll doesn't crash any more

2001-03-17  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * add dialog for library settings - it's a bit crude :(

2001-03-16  Christian Couder <christian@kdevelop.org>
    * global bookmarks, there are still bugs and the implementation
      will probably change.

2001-03-16  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * Closing and reopen edit files should work now without crash.
    * There were bugs in the DocViewMan...

2001-03-14  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * now QextMDI can look like an SDI application! :-)  (the 4. MDI mode we have got)
    * new QextMdiChildView constructor added (by Eva Brucherseifer, Thanks!)
    * some 0L pointer access bugfixes
    * bugfix: raise on click works now also for afterwards inserted child widgets
    * setPixmap in childview calls setPixmap in childframe as expected
    * taskbar button count == 0L works properly now

2001-03-14  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * got rid of s_tab_view, DocViewMan::currentDocType() added and used
    * some bugfixes (Roland Krause's crash on startup as well)
    * switch of tree views adapted

2001-03-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * bugfixes: crash on exit (wrong type casts, forgot to remove browser view from MDI control)

2001-03-12  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * further work on MDI, some connect()s from init...() moved to DocViewMan::createView()
    * some bugfixes in the DocViewMan

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * clearBookmarks() is a KWriteDoc method now, KWrite::clearBookmark() just calls its KWriteDoc
    * KWriteDoc: setFileName(), setModified(), setText(), isModified() is public now (for direct access of the document (documents are the central place in an MDI architecture))
    * architecture changed in a way that cpp_widget and header_widget is away now, use CKDevelop::m_docViewManager for those things now

2001-03-11  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * DocViewMan bugfixes
    * adapted these CKDevelop slots: slotOptionsEditor, slotOptionsEditorColors, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlightingDefaults, slotOptionsSyntaxHighlighting

    * replaced all edit_widget in CKDevelop by m_docViewManager->currentEditView()
    * other MDI stuff

2001-03-07  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * add sharedlib_rootname and sharedlib_LDFLAGS to project file. These can
      be set against each sharedlib, which allows us to use kdevelop to
      regenerate the Makefile.am for kdevelop.
      Regenerate the Makefile.ams and restore the project file.
      Add Roland's buildmake patch. This tidies up the buildmake process a good
      deal.
      
2001-03-06  F@lk Brettschneider <falk@kdevelop.org>
    * initial code for QextMDI-based MDI feature added:
        - The DocViewMan is the MDI manager which is responsible for creating documents and multiple views on such documents ;
        - CKDevelop::initView() adapted
        - CKDevelop::switchToFile(..) adapted
        - CEditWidget adapted a little bit, some methods are public now in KWriteDoc, KWriteView and KWrite
    * the whole thing is very unusable, I just give other developers the chance to contribute, stay tuned for further development...

2001-03-06  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Dirs containing "++" would cause kimport to fail.

2001-02-26  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Window placement at startup was wrong
             Screen width missed iconBorder width adjustment.
             patch Jens Zurheide <jens.zurheide@gmx.de>

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: CPrint dialog had problems with null params.
             based on patch from 
             Ravikiran Rajagopal <ravi@ee.eng.ohio-state.edu> 

2001-02-25  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: Creating a cpp project didn't work.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: kimport was run directly requiring perl to be in
      /usr/bin. This was incorrect. When this failed it revealed
      a crash in the classparser which should not be called if
      reading the project files failed.

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Remove restriction on version numbers

2001-02-24  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed: after a distclean if the qt dir wasn't entered then the
      configure args ended up being "--with-qt-dir= ". This failed the
      qt configure test.

2001-02-23  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Fixed Multiple tools beng started after adding a tool
      grep support for Solaris - find params needed adjusting
      Update of QExtMDI template.

2001-02-20ish
    * kdevelop1.4 tagged for release as KDE_2_1_RELEASE. If you 
      want bug fixes and other small enhancements then continue to
      extract kdevelop using the branch of KDEVELOP_1_4.

2000-12-30  jbb <jbb@kdevelop.org>
    * Ported 1.3 to kde2 - This is an interim version that
      allows users to do away with kde1 whilst kdevelop2.0 is
      being developed.
