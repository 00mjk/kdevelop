-------------------------------------

1. What is KDevelop ?

KDevelop is an easy to use IDE (Intergrated Development Enviroment) for
Unix/X11, targeting on C/C++ application development; specialized on the Qt/KDE and GNOME libraries.
KDevelop-Homepage :http://www.kdevelop.org

2. Requirements

In order to successfully compile (the installation with binary rpms/debs is recommed)
and use KDevelop, you need following programs and libraries:  	

required:
------------------
g++ 2.8/egcs 1.0.3 (or compatible)
GNU make
perl 5.004
autoconf 2.12
automake 1.4
Qt 1.44 NOT Qt 2.0 for compilation,qt-devel
KDE 1.1.x (kdelibs,kdebase),kde-devel
flex
db (berkley database)


optional:
-----------------------
gdb 4.18 (do not use 4.17, I've been told it has some problems)
KDE-SDK
sgmltools 1
Glimpse >= 4.1 or htDig 3.1.x
KIconEdit
KDbg
enscript
Gv, Ghostview, KGhostview
cvs >= 1.10


3. Installation

see INSTALL in this directory.
If you want to use the htDig search engine please see the
README.htdig file.
Note: By default, KDevelop is configured to use kdoc 1 from the kdesdk
to generate documentation. If you have kdoc 2 installed on your system
(which takes slightly different arguments), you should configure with
--enable-kdoc2. On a Debian system, you should use --enable-docbase.


4. KDevelop1.3 running under KDE2

This is easy on some platforms and difficult on others. 

SuSE 6.4/7.0 - no problems, just install the KDE1 and KDE2 packages, 
	but you only develop for KDE1 or KDE2 because qt1devel package conflicts with qt2devel
Mandrake 7.x - there is a kde1-compat package, but several problems are reported
RedHat 7.x - there is a kde1-compat package

If you have other or more detailed informations, please send an email to smeier@kdevelop.org

a solution which works on every platform:
Compile kde1 and qt1 yourself and use following script to start KDevelop (idea by  Ivan Hawkes)
(Please modify it to your needs)

--------------
#!/bin/sh
export KDEDIR=/opt/kde
export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-1.4.5
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$KDEDIR/lib:$QTDIR/lib
export PATH=$PATH:$KDEDIR/bin:$QTDIR/bin
$KDEDIR/bin/kdevelop
--------------

We are sorry for these difficulties to run KDevelop under KDE2, but it is a fault of distributions who doesn't ship a correct kde1compat package. We can't fix problems for every distribution. :-(

5. Import of autoconf/automake-based projects

KDevelop 1.3 contains a script "kimport", contributed by Ulrich Eckhardt
<doomster@knuut.de>, which writes a .kdevprj file out of the analysed
project's makefiles. The generated .kdevprj needs some editing before
it can be used to build a KDevelop project.
For usage information please type 'kimport --help'.

6. Convert KDevelop1.x dialogs to  QT-Designer dialogs

KDevelop2 will not contain the old dialog editor from KDevelop1.x, so we recommend to use QT-Desiger or similar programs for your applications in the future.
There is a script called "kdevdlg2ui" to convert legacy KDevelop dialogs to Qt-Designer dialogs

TODO: how to use the convert tool

7. Trouble shooting (please read the FAQ for more information)

If you want to compile KDevelop yourself or want to develop for X/Qt/KDE 
please make sure that you have installed the following packages.

xdevel.rpm (or similar)
qtdevel.rpm (or similar)
qtcompat.rpm (SuSE)
qtext.rpm (SuSE)
kde-devel.rpm (Mandrake/Redhat)
kde-libs-devel.rpm (Mandrake/Redhat)

Please set the KDEDIR to the correct KDE path (SuSE /opt/kde, RedHat 6.x /usr/, Slackware /opt/kde)
On Red Hat 6.x please set the QTDIR variable to the Qt 1.44 dir, NOT to QT 2.0


Have fun!
