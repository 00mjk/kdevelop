KDevelop 3.0 Alpha 4 Release
----------------------------

Since this project is code named Gideon, the binary that builds is called
"gideon" instead of "kdevelop".  This will allow users to use older
versions of kdevelop while still being able to experiment with this new
version.

KDE API Documentation
---------------------------
If the KDE API documentation does not exist, it can be created
as follows:

  Install doxygen and the kdelibs sources. Then

  make apidox
  make apidox-install


For the graphical classbrowser, you need the program 'dot'
from the graphviz package which can be downloaded from
www.graphviz.org. This is only a runtime dependency!

If you are experiencing build problems related to .moc files, try
  rm *.moc*
  make force-reedit
in the source directory where the build system complains.
