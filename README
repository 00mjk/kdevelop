KDevelop 3.0 Alpha 1 Release
----------------------------

Since this project is code named Gideon, the binary that builds is called
"gideon" instead of "kdevelop".  This will allow users to use older
versions of kdevelop while still being able to experiment with this new
version.

KDE/Qt API Documentation
---------------------------
If the Qt and KDE API documentation do not exist, they can be created
as follows: Install kdoc and the kdelibs sources. Then

  qt2kdoc -o ~/.kdoc /usr/lib/qt2/doc/html
  [ goto kdelibs sources ]
  makekdedoc

For the graphical classbrowser, you need the program 'dot'
from the graphviz package which can be downloaded from
www.graphviz.org. This is only a runtime dependency!

If you are experiencing build problems related to .moc files, try
  rm *.moc*
  make force-reedit
in the source directory where the build system complains.
