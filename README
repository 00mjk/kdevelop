Compilation under KDE 2.2 and KDE 3
-----------------------------------
Currently, compile and execution is supported for both KDE 2.2 and KDE 3 (HEAD). You can maintain 
buildtrees for both systems by using VPATH:
mkdir kde22
mkdir kde3
make -f Makefile.cvs
cd kde22
.././configure --with-qt-dir=/your-qt-2.3.x-dir --prefix=/your-kde22-dir --enable-gideon-qt2; make
cd ../kde3
.././configure --with-qt-dir=/your-qt-copy-dir --prefix=/your-kde3-dir; make

The keyword is --enable-gideon-qt2 if you want to build kdevelop under KDE 2.2


KDE/Qt API Documentation
---------------------------
If the Qt and KDE API documentation do not exist, they can be created
as follows: Install kdoc and the kdelibs sources. Then

  qt2kdoc -o ~/.kdoc /usr/lib/qt2/doc/html
  [ goto kdelibs sources ]
  makekdedoc

For the graphical classbrowser, you need the program 'dot'
from the graphviz package which can be downloaded from
www.graphviz.org. This is only a runtime dependency!

If you are experiencing build problems related to .moc files, try
  rm *.moc*
  make force-reedit
in the source directory where the build system complains.
