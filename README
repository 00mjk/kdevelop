If the Qt and KDE API documentation do not exist, they can be created
as follows: Install kdoc and the kdelibs sources. Then

  qt2kdoc -o ~/.kdoc /usr/lib/qt2/doc/html
  [ goto kdelibs sources ]
  makekdedoc

For the graphical classbrowser, you need the program 'dot'
from the graphviz package which can be downloaded from
www.graphviz.org. This is only a runtime dependency!
