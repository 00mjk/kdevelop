3. Requirements

In order to successfully compile und use KDevelop, you need following
programs and libraries: 	

required:
------------------
g++ 2.8/egcs 1.0.3 (or compatible)
GNU make
perl 5.004
autoconf 2.12
automake 1.4
Qt 1.44 NOT Qt 2.0

Note: By default, KDevelop is configured to use kdoc 1 from the kdesdk
to generate documentation. If you have kdoc 2 installed on your system
(which takes slightly different arguments), you should configure with
--enable-kdoc2. On a Debian system, you should use --enable-docbase.


4. Installation

see INSTALL in this directory

5. Trouble shooting (please read the FAQ for more information)

If you want to compile KDevelop yourself or want to develop for X/Qt/KDE 
please make sure that you have installed the following packages.

xdevel.rpm (or similar)
qtdevel.rpm (or similar)
qtcompat.rpm (SuSE)
qtext.rpm (SuSE)

Please set the KDEDIR to the correct KDE path (SuSE /opt/kde, RedHat 6.x /usr/, Slackware /opt/kde)
On Red Hat 6.1 please set the QTDIR variable to the Qt 1.44 dir, NOT to QT 2.0

Have fun!
