        <label>Schedule all project source code to be parsed by the language support in the background</label>
        <whatsthis>If this option is set, KDevelop will shedule all source code
        found by the current build system for parsing by the appropriate language
        support part.  This will enable more complete language support, but may
        be slower.</whatsthis>
