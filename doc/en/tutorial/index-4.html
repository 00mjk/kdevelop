<H3><A NAME="s4">4. The MDI Framework</A></H3>

<P>If you're already familiar with previous versions of KDevelop, you will know that your IDE uses so-called "frameworks" as a starting
point of application development. These frameworks by default contain a support for a generic document-view model, but were limited to
SDI (Single Document Interface, one window with one view area) model structures. From KDevelop 1.1 on, the application wizard is
capable of a lot more than the previous versions: it offers some new project types especially for those developers that want to stay
up-to-date with the upcoming KDE 2 as well as for Qt 2.1. One major extension are MDI application frameworks for both, KDE 2 and Qt
2.1. These frameworks differ only in the use of some library functions such as file dialogs or message boxes as well as the used
toolbar and statusbar classes - the KDE version uses KDE 2 methods, the Qt version the according Qt functions.
<P>To create the fist step of this tutorial application <EM>KScribble</EM>, be sure that you have followed the instructions in chapter 2
of this tutorial handbook: setting up KDE 2. If that went all right, nothing can go wrong. If you couldn't set up the KDE 2 libraries,
be sure that you have Qt-2.1 installed and set up KDevelop for that at least. You can follow this tutorial by choosing the according Qt
framework as well (which has the differences as mentioned above: other method calls for dialogs and GUI components).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Creating an MDI Framework</A>
</H3>

<P>Now we will start jumping into development by creating the frame application for <EM>KScribble</EM>. Start KDevelop and choose
"Project"-"New" from the menubar to invoke the application wizard. On the first page, you will be shown a tree of project types. These
contain KDE and Qt projects. There, select "KDE 2 MDI" from the KDE section. If you only have Qt 2.1 installed, choose "Qt 2.1 MDI"
from the Qt section.
