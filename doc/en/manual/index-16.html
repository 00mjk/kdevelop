<H3><A NAME="Questions and Answers"></A> <A NAME="s16">16. Questions and Answers</A></H3>

<P>This section addresses questions by users that were answered by the KDevelop Team or by their supporters on the KDevelop
mailing list during experiences with the current versions of KDevelop as well as bug reporting in general.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Bug Reporting"></A> <A NAME="ss16.1">16.1 Bug Reporting </A>
</H3>

<P>Another improvement of KDevelop is the integrated bug-reporting system via email. If you experience a bug, you have the option to send
the KDevelop development team a bug report either by your email-client or by the bug-report dialog. All bug-reports are collected on
the KDevelop web site and can be reviewed on 
<A HREF="http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html">http://bugs.kde.org//db/pa/lkdevelop.html</A>. 
<P>To send bug reports, please use the email address 
<A HREF="mailto:submit@bugs.kde.org">submit@bugs.kde.org</A>. If you want to use KDevelop for direct bug-reporting, choose
"Bug Report" from the Help-menu. You are presented the report dialog that lets you enter all necessary information about the
bug you found. After pressing "OK", the dialog's contents is sent there automatically.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss16.2">16.2 Where to get Information</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Q:</B> I have a question which is not addressed in the FAQ file, nor in the manuals of KDevelop. Where should I turn to ?
<P><B>A:</B>  In any case send all requests that are regarding KDevelop by subscribing to the KDevelop mailing list at 
<A HREF="mailto:kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de">kdevelop-request@barney.cs.uni-potsdam.de</A>. Send a mail with an empty header and
"subscribe youremailaddres" as contents; then you can participate on the discussions. All questions should go there and will be addressed there as well.
If you stick to that, you will get the most help by the developers and all users having the same problems, as well as helping to keep
the FAQ up to date.
<P>The KDevelop Homepage at 
<A HREF="http://www.kdevelop.org">http://www.kdevelop.org</A> also contains a mailing-list archive that allows you to browse
the mails already send by the subscribers, so you should look there first as most problems should have been addressed already by the
team or other users.

<H3><A NAME="ss16.3">16.3 Library and System Problems</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> Wrong JPEG library version: library is 61, caller expects 62
<P><B>A:</B>  There are 2 ways.
<OL>
<LI> When the kdelibs are installed it installs header files for the
jpeg libraries, these are version 61,  however most distributions
(Redhat) use version 62 libraries. To fix  this just remove jpeglib.h
from /opt/kde/include. The pukka include  file for version 62 should
then be picked up. However looking at the  error message above it may
be the other way round, in any case ensure  you only have on version
of the header file, the library and that  they are consistent.

It is useful to use the locate command to verify that I have
the correct version of a library and header files e.g.
updatedb
locate libjpeg
locate jpeglib
</LI>
<LI> You must recompiled kdesupport without jpeg
library (./configure --with-libjpeg --with-libgif).</LI>
</OL>

<B>A:</B> If you have the SuSE rpm´s of KDE-1.1, you must recompile the kdelibs without the patch commited by SuSE and reinstall
them or get an updated rpm of the kdelibs from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.suse.com">ftp://ftp.suse.com</A><P><B>Q:</B> Configure complains about the Qt version not being between 1.44 and 2.00
<P><B>A:</B> You probably have Qt2.00 installed on your system, and this messes up ./configure. For the purpose of compiling
KDevelop you should set QTDIR to the correct directory.
<P><B>Q:</B> Configure complains about not being able to compile a small KDE application. Examining config.log reveals that it
can't find the library libXext.
<P><B>A:</B> Install the package xdevel
<P><B>Q:</B> I´m already running a KDE 2 snapshot and I want to use KDevelop under KDE 2. What is the best way to do this ?
<P><B>A:</B> As KDevelop for KDE 2 is currently under development, you should consider using the current stable 1.x release of
KDevelop for production usage. Running KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 can be done by creating a shell-script:
<P>#/bin/bash
QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-1.44 export QTDIR
KDEDIR=/opt/kde export KDEDIR
exec /opt/kde/bin/kdevelop
<P>Save this file as e.g. kdevelop1 and set this file to executable with
<P>chmod 755 kdevelop1
<P>Then you can run KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 by calling kdevelop1.
For developing KDE 2 applications with KDevelop 1.x you have to set the correct
path in the KDevelop Setup even if you´re running KDevelop under KDE 2 !

<H3><A NAME="ss16.4">16.4 Usage Questions</A>
</H3>

<P><B>Q:</B> I see the KDevelop does not allow for usage of the delete key (or backspace deleting when text is marked).
<P><B>A:</B>  go to "Options"->"Editor" and make sure that "Delete on Input" is enabled, then backspace and delete works.
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> If I add files to my project, will they be automatically included and compiled ?
<P><B>A:</B> Yes, they are included in the Makefile.am's then and if you make a "Rebuild All" (./configure updates the Makefiles), your new
added files will be included as well.
<P><B>Q:</B> If I removed a file, I get some weird Linker messages. What is wrong with my project ?
<P><B>A:</B> If the removed file is a header file, that is automatically processed by automoc (running the Qt-Meta-Object-Compiler
automatically on all headers), your removed header is still present as a moc-generated *.moc.cpp file and compiled.  Remove the
according *.moc.cpp file and rebuild the project.
<P><B>Q:</B> Configure complains about not being able to compile a small KDE
application. Examining config.log reveals that it can't find the library
libXext.
<P><B>A:</B> Install the package xdevel
<P><B>Q:</B> I´m developing an application where I need to set -D options to the preprocessor. If I add these
in KDevelop to my project options, everything is ok, but when I distribute my package, the -D options set in
KDevelop are not used. What do I have to do to make this work ?
<P><B>A:</B> Edit the file configure.in in your toplevel source directory. Here, you have to enter somewhere at
the beginning:
<P>CXXFLAGS=$(CXXFLAGS) " -DYOURDEFINE"
AC_SUBST(CXXFLAGS)
<P>
<P><B>Q:</B> I´m already running a KDE 2 snapshot and I want to use KDevelop under KDE 2. What is the best way
to do this ?
<P><B>A:</B> As KDevelop for KDE 2 is currently under development, you should consider using the current stable
1.x release of KDevelop for production usage. Running KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 can be done by creating a
shell-script:
<P>#/bin/bash
QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt-1.44 export QTDIR
KDEDIR=/opt/kde export KDEDIR
exec /opt/kde/bin/kdevelop
<P>Save this file as e.g. kdevelop1 and set this file to executable with
<P>chmod 755 kdevelop1
<P>Then you can run KDevelop 1.x under KDE 2 by calling kdevelop1.
For developing KDE 2 applications with KDevelop 1.x you have to set the correct path in the KDevelop Setup
even if you´re running KDevelop under KDE 2 !
<P><B>Q:</B> I'm using a KDevelop 1.4 which is already KDE2 enabled. There is no dialog editor any more. How do I create my dialogs ?
<P><B>A:</B> Since KDevelop 1.4 the QT designer is used for creating dialogs. But not only the tool has changed but also the way
how dialogs are designed and used from within KDevelop. To create a new dialog choose new from the file dialog and create a new QT
designer (*.ui) file. Now the designer is opened and you can develop your dialog. ATTENTION: most QT packages (*.deb,*.rpm) does
not include support for KDE widgets. You need this to use e.g. KListView or other KDE widgets in your dialogs.  After creating
the dialog, you inherit your dialog class from the newly created dialog.
<P><B>Q:</B> I have downloaded the QT-2.2.x packages from ftp.kde.org and there are now KDE widgets available in the designer. How
can I get them ? A: You have to recompile QT with ./configure -kde as additional option. Remember to set $KDEDIR and $QTDIR to the
appropriate directories. After doing so you have an option KDE in the tools menue of the designer.
<P><B>Q:</B> I use RedHat Linux with KDevelop and tried to recompile the QT library with -kde in order to use the designer with KDE
widget support but  during configure it says that $KDEDIR does not contain a valid KDE installation ? A: RedHat uses a
non-standard directory setting with KDE. The normal case would be that the libs are in $KDEDIR/lib, binaries in $KDEDIR/bin
and includes in $KDEDIR/include. RedHat uses /usr as $KDEDIR but $KDEDIR/include/kde as directory for  header files. Therefore
configure from QT fails to detect the correct directories. It searches dcopserver in the binaries folder and the header files in
their folder. So if you choose $KDEDIR to be /usr, configure can't find the includes. A possible solution for this is to create a
/usr/local/kde     directory and set symlinks to /usr/bin and /usr/include/kde in this "pseudo" kde dir. Then export
KDEDIR=/usr/local/kde and do the ./configure -kde. After compiling QT you have the KDE entries in the tools menu of the QT
designer.
<P><B>Q:</B> Is there any HOWTO available on how to work with QT designer made dialogs ?
<P><B>A:</B> Yes, there is a great tutorial on http://women.kde.org/docs/tut_kdevelop/
<P><B>Q:</B> I have installed htdig but there is now htsearch available ?
<P><B>A:</B> On e.g. RedHat systems the htsearch executable is placed in the /cgi-bin dir of apache. You can create symlinks in /usr/bin or simply add this path ro &nbsp;/.bashrc
<P><B>Q:</B> I have htdig, htmerge and htsearch available but I get an error message thet the config file of htdig could not be
found or is invalid ? A: Read README.htdig in the source directory tree and create a htdig.conf file. Then copy it to $KDEDIR/share/apps/kdevelop/tools. Now create your search index with the kdevelop setup menu.
