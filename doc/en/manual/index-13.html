<P>
<P>KDevelop also takes care of managing your project via CVS repositories. The goal behind CVS (concurrent 
version control) is to enable groups of developers to work on the same source-tree independently and to merge 
changes into the repository. Usually, the repository is located at a server. The initial repository contains 
the base set of files that the project includes; directories and files are then added or removed to the CVS by 
the developers. Locally, the developer works on his copy of the CVS tree. He writes his changes into his files 
and tests, if his project still works, at least to a certain extend where incomplete sources don't prevent 
other developers from still working on the CVS repository if they receive the changes. 
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Creating a Repository</A>
</H3>

<P>When creating a new project with KDevelop, you can directly import the project as a CVS module. To enable 
this, you have to have CVS installed (which should be already, if not, revise your system installation or 
contact your system administrator).
<P>On the third page of the KAppWizard (VCS support), choose "CVS". Then the editing fields of this page get 
active and you can specify the import parameters, see below for the given options. The KAppWizard will then 
import the project source tree as a module into the CVS root directory and create your new project as a local 
copy of the CVS source tree that you will be working on.
<P><B>Attention:</B> to create an initial repository, you have to have write  access to the CVS root directory 
! Also the CVS root directory has to be on the same machine where you´re running KDevelop ! If you want to 
have the repository on a dedicated CVS server either contact this servers´ system administrator to create the 
project with KDevelop on the server machine or do the following steps: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>create your project locally</LI>
<LI>import the project source tree as a module on the CVS server</LI>
<LI>delete local project source tree</LI>
<LI>check out the project source tree from CVS </LI>
<LI>enable CVS support in the project options dialog as described below after loading the project file of 
your CVS copy you checked out.</LI>
</UL>
   
<P>For more details on CVS commands, please revise your system help on cvs, e.g. by doing a <CODE>man cvs</CODE>.
<P>In the following we will discuss the options when creating a repository with the KAppWizard
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>VCS Location:</B><DD><P>This is the CVS root directory where the project source tree will be imported and where 
commits, checkouts and updates take place.
<DT><B>Repository in CVS</B><DD><P>This is the module name given for your project. As this is the same as your project 
directory you can´t change that.
<DT><B>Vendor Tag</B><DD><P>this is a tag for the entire branch
<DT><B>Log Message</B><DD><P>is the first log message entry of the new module. When adding or commiting to the 
repository, you will be asked for a log message each time to document your changes to the repository source 
tree.
<DT><B>Release Tag</B><DD><P>this specifies the tag under which your project source tree can be found, meaning that you 
can create several projects with the same module name in the CVS root which differ in the tag, so you can work 
on different branches of the same project. Example: KDE 2 is developed under the tag HEAD (default tag), KDE 
1.1.2. can be found in the tag KDE_1_1_2_RELEASE.
</DL>
 
<P>After creating your project with the KAppWizard, the CVS support option is already set for your project, so 
you can commit and add changes in the way described below in the section "Using CVS Commands".
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 Enabling CVS Support</A>
</H3>

<P>As CVS support is most often only needed by professionals or companies as well as by KDE developers maintaining their project over the
KDE CVS server, using the CVS commands of KDevelop is optional. To enable the CVS commands, open the Project-Options dialog and change
the option for Version Control to "CVS".
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3 Using CVS Commands</A>
</H3>

<P>Then the following commands are available in the LFV and RFV by context menus:
<P>Over a file not included in the repository:
<UL>
<LI><B>Add to Repository</B>: adds the file to the repository. The file is set up to be added and will be introduced to the repository
on the next <CODE>commit</CODE> command that includes the directory where the added file is located locally.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over a file included in the repository:
<UL>
<LI><B>Update</B>: update the selected file with the CVS version</LI>
<LI><B>Commit</B>: commit the selected file to the CVS repository</LI>
<LI><B>Remove from Repository</B>: remove the file from the repository</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over a folder:
<UL>
<LI><B>Add</B>: adds the folder to the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Remove</B>: removes the folder from the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Update</B>: update the folder recursively to be in sync with the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Commit</B>: commit any changes recursively to the repository</LI>
</UL>
<P>The CVS commands all require a working network connection to the CVS server. When invoking a command, you will be shown a dialog with
the command sent to the CVS server and the retrieved output. Thereby you can control what actually happens and if the command was
successful or not.
<P>As the CVS commands of KDevelop only work with the <CODE>cvs</CODE> system command and its commandline options, you should have no trouble to
use the cvs features.
