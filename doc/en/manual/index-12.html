<H3><A NAME="Debugging Applications"></A> <A NAME="s12">12. Debugging Applications</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Setup</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The default setup for KDevelop is to use the internal debugger. You can
change this under Options select the &quot;KDevelop setup&quot; menu item,
and then the Debugger tab.
<P>Click on &quot;Use external debugger&quot; if you wish to use a different
debugger and enter the name of the debugger to use. See your debuggers documentation
on how to run it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Using the internal debugger</A>
</H3>

<P>
<H4>Changes made in the tree and output view window</H4>

<P>If you choose the internal debugger, three tabs are added to your tree and output view windows.
<H4>On the tree view window</H4>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>VAR tab : A tree view of the local variables at the current place in
the  program you have stopped at. You can also see local variables in the
function  that called this funtions. The VAR tab also contains a watch window.
This allows  you to see the value of global variables, or perhaps you may want
to see only  one local variable rather than the variable in a large list of
local variables.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>On the output view window</H4>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>breakpoint : A list of breakpoints set and there currrent state.</LI>
<LI>framestack : The calling stack.</LI>
<LI>disassemble : A machine instruction view of the code showing the current instruction to be executed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Details</H4>

<P>
<P>
<H4>Breakpoints</H4>

<P>
<P>Breakpoints can be set against source lines in a file (referred to as breakpoints)
or on variables in the source (referred to as watchpoints). Both types of breakpoints
can be set at anytime, however watchpoints on local variables only have meaning
in the variables local scope. Watchpoints have more meaning when you are dealing
with global variables.
<P>
<H4>Set/Unset breakpoints</H4>

<P>
<P>Simple one click set/unset. Click on the &quot;icon&quot; border to the
left of the text in the editor at the line you want the breakpoint. Click again
on this line to unset the breakpoint.
<P>
<H4>Alternative beakpoint manipulating via menus</H4>

<P>
<P>By right clicking on a breakpoint in the breakpoint list or on a breakpoint
in the editors icon border you will get a menu of breakpoint options. This
allows you to remove this breakpoint, clear all breakpoints, or edit the breakpoint.
<P>
<H4>Editing breakpoints</H4>

<P>
<P>Use the above menu to display the edit breakpoint dialog. 
This contains the following fields :
<OL>
<LI>Conditional: Enter the condition that must be met before gdb will interrupt
the program execution.</LI>
<LI>Ignore count: How many times you want to the code to past through this
breakpoint before gdb interrupts the program execution.</LI>
<LI>Enable: When enabled gdb will break at this breakpoint. When disabled gdb
will not break here.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H4>Clear all breakpoints</H4>

<P>
<P>Removes all the breakpoints for this program.
<P>
<H4>Set/Unset watchpoints</H4>

<P>
<P>In the VAR view click with the Right Mouse button on a variable. A popup
menu will be displayed allowing you to set a watchpoint on the local variable.
This functionality is limited to the scope that the local variable is in. As
the variable goes out of scope the program breaks and the watchpoint is deleted.
<P>WARNING: This is known to be problematic, so use caution when setting
watchpoints on local variables.
<P>The watchpoint can also be set by a right mouse click on a previously entered
watch variable, and selecting &quot;toggle watchpoint&quot;
<P>
<H4>Set/Unset Watch variables</H4>

<P>
<P>At the bottom of the VAR view there is the &quot;Watch&quot; field where
you can enter the variable name you wish to see display in the watch list.
Enter the variable name and type &quot;enter&quot; or click on the &quot;Add&quot;
button alongside the field. Right Mouse clicking on the watch variable in the
treeview will bring up a menu so that you can remove the variable from the
list.
<P>You can also enter a watch variable by right mouse clicking on a variabel
name in the editor window. This displays a popup menu with &quot;watch: variable
name&quot; on it.
<H4>Changing variable values</H4>

<P>
<P>This is done via the watch variable. If you have a variable &quot;test&quot;
then to set &quot;test&quot; to 5 type &quot;test=5&quot; in the watch
field and add it to the list. Note that &quot;test&quot; will be set to &quot;5&quot;
EVERY time the program stops at a breakpoint, so once you have set the variable,
usually you should remove the item from the watch view.
<P>
<H4>The floating toolbar</H4>

<P>
<P>The debugger toolbar is either on top of all windows displayed, or docked
in the panel. When docked you can run you code by clicking on the docked icon.
The function this performs is the &quot;step over&quot; function. Right clicking
on the docked item allows you to restore the toolbar and optionally place focus
on kdevelop.
<P>The functions available are:
<UL>
<LI>Run : Continue the program from the current point.</LI>
<LI>Step over  : Execute one line of code stopping on the next
line of code in the same surce file. This will run any functions encountered
until the above condition is met.</LI>
<LI>Step over i(nstruction) : Execute one machine instruction as above.</LI>
<LI>Step in : Execute exactly one source line of code. This
means you will &quot;step into&quot; the current function, if necessary</LI>
<LI>Step in i(nstruction) : Execute one machine instruction as above.</LI>
<LI>Step out : Run to the end of the current stack frame (function)</LI>
<LI>View : Allows a variety of views into the data.
Currently implemented views are:
<OL>
<LI> Memory address</LI>
<LI> Disassemble code</LI>
<LI> Current registers</LI>
<LI> Current libraries</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>Interrupt : Stop the application executing.</LI>
<LI>Set focus on kdevelop : Set the focus on kdevelop</LI>
<LI>Set focus on app : This sets the focus on the window that had focus
when you pressed the &quot;set focus on kdevelop&quot; button. This is a
compromise, it should set the focus on the application being debugged but this
is difficult to do. If anyone has a better solution than the current functionality
then please let us know.</LI>
</UL>
<P>When gdb interrupts the program, probably because a breakpoint has been
triggered, we highlight the &quot;Set focus on kdevelop&quot;. We do not
automatically switch focus to kdevelop so that you can view the application
window at this point. Click on the &quot;set focus&quot; button to switch
to kdevelop or press a button on the toolbar to perform your selected function.
