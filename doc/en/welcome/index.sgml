<title>Welcome To KDevelop !
<subtitle>Welcome to the KDevelop Integrated Development Environment !
<p>
The KDevelop IDE has been designed by the KDevelop Team to provide an easy-to use environment for C/C++ programmers. With all it's
features the current version contains, the full amount of programming knowledge of the team has been collected to add a set of
documentation handbooks that will help beginners as well as experts in various parts of using their IDE. We hope to give you the
environment you need and like to use for creating your application that contributes to the K Desktop Environment and the free software
community as well as for any commercial purpose.

Currently, the KDevelop Documentation spans over four handbooks full of well-written, informative and understandable text that will
enable you to start developing your applications:
