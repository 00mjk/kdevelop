<H3><A NAME="s15">15. Programming Guidelines</A></H3>

<P>
<P>Close to the end of this handbook, I want to summarize several issues that programmers should watch out while coding. These are mostly
C++ programming tips that relate to KDE and Qt programming especially and are taken from the KDE Developer's Center which can be found
on the Internet at 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">http://www.kde.org</A>.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Filenames</B><DD><P>First of all, when creating sourcefiles, you should always use lowercase filenames. KDevelop supports
this guideline already if you stick to its filename aut-suggestion. This makes it easier for other developers to remember what source
files to look for when they have to debug your application.
<P>
<DT><B>Classnames</B><DD><P>The classnaming for KDE projects is recommended to be:
<UL>
<LI>class names should begin with a prefixed <B>K</B> followed by the name of the class by purpose (your choice). This would be e.g.
<CODE>KMyWidget</CODE> for an application specific widget.</LI>
<LI>the class members should always begin with lowercase letters, followed by uppercase beginnings for the next word, e.g.
<CODE>myWidgetPointer()</CODE></LI>
<LI>methods that return a private members value shouldn't use the <CODE>get</CODE>-prefix. You should prefer using a descriptive name for
those types of classmembers. Example: <CODE>b_myboolean</CODE> is a private member. The method returning the current value would be e.g.
<CODE>myBoolean()</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<DT><B>File access within code</B><DD><P>Hardcoding any path should be avoided by using the KDE File System Standard. You only have to watch the installation path for your
files by the according macros of the <CODE>Makefile.am</CODE> as described in this handbook. Within the code, you should use the methods of
<CODE>KApplication</CODE> to retrieve the actual path.
<P>
<DT><B>Class documentation</B><DD><P>Another thing already mentionend is class documentation. You should stick to use <CODE>KDoc</CODE> formatting rules as they are used by all KDE
developers to document their classes. You should at least add a single line to all of your classmembers for yourself to remember the
prurpose and for others to reuse code. The code-reuse by the GPL makes much more sense if you know where to find an already existing
solution if classes are documented. The Qt library referece is a good example of well-documented interfaces, though it doesn't use
<CODE>KDoc</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B>Use <CODE>new</CODE> to create widgets</B><DD><P>Within your implementation, you should always prefer to create widgets on the heap with <CODE>new</CODE>. The Qt library has a nice habbit to
automatically delete all child widgets you created with <CODE>new</CODE>, so you don't ever have to use <CODE>delete</CODE> again in those cases. This
is one of the most important practical features of the Qt library and you should make <P ALIGN="RIGHT">
