>As mentioned earlier, the KDE project does not mandate any single Open Source license as long as the license is Open Source. By far, the most common license for the KDE libraries is LGPL, and the most common for applications is GPL. Code that we may explicitly want people to incorporate into (possibly closed-source) applications may use other licenses.</P

><P
>If you have followed the KDE Project for any length of time, you have likely encountered <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The GPL is not compatible with Qt"</SPAN
> threads. The issues surrounding this are unfortunately quite ambiguous and highly open to interpretation. There has never been a court case involving the GPL, so all opinions have no solid legal basis. The argument is slightly different based on what version of Qt is involved. Specifically, the arguments have largely gone away with the release of Qt 2.2.</P
><P
>Qt 1.45 and earlier versions were covered under the FreeQt license. The FreeQt license was not an Open Source license. On one point, the GPL is quite clear: you may not mix GPL and nonfree code. That meant that the KDE project could not mix Qt code inside of the KDE libraries. Because the FreeQt license prohibited redistributing individual files from Qt, this was never a problem.</P
><P
>However, some free software advocates claimed that you could not link GPL code with nonfree libraries. They insisted that because KDE applications were GPL, they were in violation by linking with the nonfree Qt library. The Debian project refused to ship KDE with its distribution as a result. The KDE project has always maintained that those advocates have misinterpreted the GPL.</P
><P
>Qt 2.0 and Qt 2.1 are covered by the QPL. The QPL is an Open Source license, so it was expected that the problems would go away. Unfortunately, the FSF has indicated that although the QPL is Open Source, it doesn't consider it to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

><P
>This all became a moot point with the release of Qt 2.2. This and later versions of the free Qt are covered under a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"dual"</SPAN
> license. The author has a choice between using it as if it was covered under the QPL or under the GPL. This last clause was very important. All libraries and applications in KDE are compatible with the GPL. Therefore, when Qt is also covered under the GPL, all possible legal ambiguity drops away. From this point, all objections by the Free Software Foundation and the Debian Project essentially just went away.</P
