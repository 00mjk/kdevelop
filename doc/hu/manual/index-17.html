<P>We like to express special thanks to all of our family members and friends who supported us in several ways to let us construct
and improve KDevelop.
<P>Further, we thank  Jochen Wilhelmy  for offering his program kwrite and his help on integrating it into KDevelop.
<P>Thanks also to the KDE team and Stephan Kulow, who gave us the possibility to work on KDevelop via CVS
<P>We hope that our free work on this product will lead to a better acceptance of Free Software and its development. Without the help
and idealism of many, the KDevelop IDE would never have been realized in such a short period of time and we're proud that so many
users already have reported good experience and brought KDevelop to it's destiny: helping free software programmers to build a
better world where users have the freedom of choice.
<P>
