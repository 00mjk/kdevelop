<P>KDevelop also takes care of managing your project via CVS repositories. The goal behind CVS (concurrent version control) is to enable
groups of developers to work on the same source-tree independently and to merge changes into the repository. Usually, the repository is
located at a server. The initial repository contains the base set of files that the project includes; directories and files are then
added or removed to the CVS by the developers.
<P>Locally, the developer works on his copy of the CVS tree. He writes his changes into his files and tests, if his project still works,
at least to a certain extend where incomplete sources don't prevent other developers from still working on the CVS repository if they
receive the changes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Enabling CVS Support</A>
</H2>

<P>As CVS support is most often only needed by professionals or companies as well as by KDE developers maintaining their project over the
KDE CVS server, using the CVS commands of KDevelop is optional. To enable the CVS commands, open the Project-Options dialog and change
the option for Version Control to "CVS".
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 Using CVS Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>Then the following commands are available in the LFV and RFV by context menus:
<P>Over a file not included in the repository:
<UL>
<LI><B>Add to Repository</B>: adds the file to the repository. The file is set up to be added and will be introduced to the repository
on the next <CODE>commit</CODE> command that includes the directory where the added file is located locally.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over a file included in the repository:
<UL>
<LI><B>Update</B>: update the selected file with the CVS version</LI>
<LI><B>Commit</B>: commit the selected file to the CVS repository</LI>
<LI><B>Remove from Repository</B>: remove the file from the repository</LI>
</UL>
<P>Over a folder:
<UL>
<LI><B>Add</B>: adds the folder to the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Remove</B>: removes the folder from the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Update</B>: update the folder recursively to be in sync with the repository</LI>
<LI><B>Commit</B>: commit any changes recursively to the repository</LI>
</UL>
<P>The CVS commands all require a working network connection to the CVS server. When invoking a command, you will be shown a dialog with
the command sent to the CVS server and the retrieved output. Thereby you can control what actually happens and if the command was
successful or not.
<P>As the CVS commands of KDevelop only work with the <CODE>cvs</CODE> system command and its commandline options, you should have no trouble to
use the cvs features.
