Channels that come from a single opening share the same file position;
we call them <STRONG>linked</STRONG> channels.  Linked channels result when you
make a stream from a descriptor using <CODE>fdopen</CODE>, when you get a
descriptor from a stream with <CODE>fileno</CODE>, when you copy a descriptor
with <CODE>dup</CODE> or <CODE>dup2</CODE>, and when descriptors are inherited
during <CODE>fork</CODE>.  For files that don't support random access, such as
terminals and pipes, <EM>all</EM> channels are effectively linked.  On
random-access files, all append-type output streams are effectively
linked to each other.

If you have been using a stream for I/O, and you want to do I/O using
another channel (either a stream or a descriptor) that is linked to it,
you must first <STRONG>clean up</STRONG> the stream that you have been using.
See section <A HREF="libc_222.html#SEC229">Cleaning Streams</A>.

</P>
<P>
Terminating a process, or executing a new program in the process,
destroys all the streams in the process.  If descriptors linked to these
streams persist in other processes, their file positions become
undefined as a result.  To prevent this, you must clean up the streams
before destroying them.
