<H3><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC105"><CODE>localeconv</CODE>: It is portable but ...</A></H3>

<P>
Together with the <CODE>setlocale</CODE> function the ISO C people
invented <CODE>localeconv</CODE> function.  It is a masterpiece of misdesign.
It is expensive to use, it is not extendable, and is not generally
usable as it provides access only to the <CODE>LC_MONETARY</CODE> and
<CODE>LC_NUMERIC</CODE> related information.  If it is applicable for a
certain situation it should nevertheless be used since it is very
portable.  In general it is better to use the function <CODE>strfmon</CODE>
which can be used to format monetary amounts correctly according to the
selected locale by implicitly using this information.

<DT><U>Function:</U> struct lconv * <B>localeconv</B> <I>(void)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX598"></A>
The <CODE>localeconv</CODE> function returns a pointer to a structure whose
components contain information about how numeric and monetary values
should be formatted in the current locale.

</P>
<P>
You should not modify the structure or its contents.  The structure might
be overwritten by subsequent calls to <CODE>localeconv</CODE>, or by calls to
<CODE>setlocale</CODE>, but no other function in the library overwrites this
value.

<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>struct lconv</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX599"></A>
This is the data type of the value returned by <CODE>localeconv</CODE>.  Its
elements are described in the following subsections.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
If a member of the structure <CODE>struct lconv</CODE> has type <CODE>char</CODE>,
and the value is <CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>, it means that the current locale has
no value for that parameter.
