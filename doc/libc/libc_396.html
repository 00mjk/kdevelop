<H2><A NAME="SEC403" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC403">Calendar Time</A></H2>

<P>
This section describes facilities for keeping track of dates and times
according to the Gregorian calendar.

There are three representations for date and time information:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>Calendar time</STRONG> (the <CODE>time_t</CODE> data type) is a compact
representation, typically giving the number of seconds elapsed since
some implementation-specific base time.
<A NAME="IDX2301"></A>

<LI>

There is also a <STRONG>high-resolution time</STRONG> representation (the <CODE>struct
timeval</CODE> data type) that includes fractions of a second.  Use this time
representation instead of ordinary calendar time when you need greater
precision.
<A NAME="IDX2302"></A>

<LI>

<STRONG>Local time</STRONG> or <STRONG>broken-down time</STRONG> (the <CODE>struct
tm</CODE> data type) represents the date and time as a set of components
specifying the year, month, and so on, for a specific time zone.
This time representation is usually used in conjunction with formatting
date and time values.
<A NAME="IDX2303"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2304"></A>
