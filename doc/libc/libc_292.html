<H3><A NAME="SEC299" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC299">Host Addresses</A></H3>

<P>
Each computer on the Internet has one or more <STRONG>Internet addresses</STRONG>,
numbers which identify that computer among all those on the Internet.
Users typically write IPv4 numeric host addresses as sequences of four
numbers, separated by periods, as in <SAMP>`128.52.46.32'</SAMP>, and IPv6
numeric host addresses as sequences of up to eight numbers separated by
colons, as in <SAMP>`5f03:1200:836f:c100::1'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Each computer also has one or more <STRONG>host names</STRONG>, which are strings
of words separated by periods, as in <SAMP>`mescaline.gnu.org'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
Programs that let the user specify a host typically accept both numeric
addresses and host names.  But the program needs a numeric address to
open a connection; to use a host name, you must convert it to the
numeric address it stands for.
