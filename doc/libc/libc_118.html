<H3><A NAME="SEC125" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC125">Programs to handle message catalogs for <CODE>gettext</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
The GNU C Library does not contain the source code for the programs to
handle message catalogs for the <CODE>gettext</CODE> functions.  As part of
the GNU project the GNU gettext package contains everything the
developer needs.  The functionality provided by the tools in this
package by far exceeds the abilities of the <CODE>gencat</CODE> program
described above for the <CODE>catgets</CODE> functions.

</P>
<P>
There is a program <CODE>msgfmt</CODE> which is the equivalent program to the
<CODE>gencat</CODE> program.  It generates from the human-readable and
-editable form of the message catalog a binary file which can be used by
the <CODE>gettext</CODE> functions.  But there are several more programs
available.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>xgettext</CODE> program can be used to automatically extract the
translatable messages from a source file.  I.e., the programmer need not
take care for the translations and the list of messages which have to be
translated.  S/He will simply wrap the translatable string in calls to
<CODE>gettext</CODE> et.al and the rest will be done by <CODE>xgettext</CODE>.  This
program has a lot of option which help to customize the output or do
help to understand the input better.

</P>
<P>
Other programs help to the manage development cycle when new messages appear
in the source files or when a new translation of the messages appear.
Here it should only be noted that using all the tools in GNU gettext it
is possible to <EM>completely</EM> automate the handling of message
catalogs.  Beside marking the translatable string in the source code and
generating the translations the developers do not have to do anything
themselves.
