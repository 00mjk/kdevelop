<H3><A NAME="SEC245" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC245">Open-time Flags</A></H3>

<P>
The open-time flags specify options affecting how <CODE>open</CODE> will behave.
These options are not preserved once the file is open.  The exception to
this is <CODE>O_NONBLOCK</CODE>, which is also an I/O operating mode and so it
<EM>is</EM> saved.  See section <A HREF="libc_214.html#SEC221">Opening and Closing Files</A>, for how to call
<CODE>open</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
There are two sorts of options specified by open-time flags.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

<STRONG>File name translation flags</STRONG> affect how <CODE>open</CODE> looks up the
file name to locate the file, and whether the file can be created.
<A NAME="IDX1118"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1119"></A>

<LI>

<STRONG>Open-time action flags</STRONG> specify extra operations that <CODE>open</CODE> will
perform on the file once it is open.
<A NAME="IDX1120"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1121"></A>
</UL>

<P>
Here are the file name translation flags.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_CREAT</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1122"></A>
If set, the file will be created if it doesn't already exist.
<A NAME="IDX1123"></A>
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_EXCL</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1124"></A>
If both <CODE>O_CREAT</CODE> and <CODE>O_EXCL</CODE> are set, then <CODE>open</CODE> fails
if the specified file already exists.  This is guaranteed to never
clobber an existing file.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_NONBLOCK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1126"></A>
This prevents <CODE>open</CODE> from blocking for a "long time" to open the
file.  This is only meaningful for some kinds of files, usually devices
such as serial ports; when it is not meaningful, it is harmless and
ignored.  Often opening a port to a modem blocks until the modem reports
carrier detection; if <CODE>O_NONBLOCK</CODE> is specified, <CODE>open</CODE> will
return immediately without a carrier.

</P>
<P>
Note that the <CODE>O_NONBLOCK</CODE> flag is overloaded as both an I/O operating
mode and a file name translation flag.  This means that specifying
<CODE>O_NONBLOCK</CODE> in <CODE>open</CODE> also sets nonblocking I/O mode;
see section <A HREF="libc_239.html#SEC246">I/O Operating Modes</A>.  To open the file without blocking but do normal
I/O that blocks, you must call <CODE>open</CODE> with <CODE>O_NONBLOCK</CODE> set and
then call <CODE>fcntl</CODE> to turn the bit off.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_NOCTTY</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1127"></A>
If the named file is a terminal device, don't make it the controlling
terminal for the process.  See section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>, for information about
what it means to be the controlling terminal.

</P>
<P>
In the GNU system and 4.4 BSD, opening a file never makes it the
controlling terminal and <CODE>O_NOCTTY</CODE> is zero.  However, other
systems may use a nonzero value for <CODE>O_NOCTTY</CODE> and set the
controlling terminal when you open a file that is a terminal device; so
to be portable, use <CODE>O_NOCTTY</CODE> when it is important to avoid this.
<A NAME="IDX1128"></A>
</DL>

</P>
<P>
The following three file name translation flags exist only in the GNU system.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_IGNORE_CTTY</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1129"></A>
Do not recognize the named file as the controlling terminal, even if it
refers to the process's existing controlling terminal device.  Operations
on the new file descriptor will never induce job control signals.
See section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_NOLINK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1130"></A>
If the named file is a symbolic link, open the link itself instead of
the file it refers to.  (<CODE>fstat</CODE> on the new file descriptor will
return the information returned by <CODE>lstat</CODE> on the link's name.)
<A NAME="IDX1131"></A>
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_NOTRANS</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1132"></A>
If the named file is specially translated, do not invoke the translator.
Open the bare file the translator itself sees.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
The open-time action flags tell <CODE>open</CODE> to do additional operations
which are not really related to opening the file.  The reason to do them
as part of <CODE>open</CODE> instead of in separate calls is that <CODE>open</CODE>
can do them <I>atomically</I>.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_TRUNC</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1133"></A>
Truncate the file to zero length.  This option is only useful for
regular files, not special files such as directories or FIFOs.  POSIX.1
requires that you open the file for writing to use <CODE>O_TRUNC</CODE>.  In
BSD and GNU you must have permission to write the file to truncate it,
but you need not open for write access.

</P>
<P>
This is the only open-time action flag specified by POSIX.1.  There is
no good reason for truncation to be done by <CODE>open</CODE>, instead of by
calling <CODE>ftruncate</CODE> afterwards.  The <CODE>O_TRUNC</CODE> flag existed in
Unix before <CODE>ftruncate</CODE> was invented, and is retained for backward
compatibility.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
The remaining operating modes are BSD extensions.  They exist only
on some systems.  On other systems, these macros are not defined.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_SHLOCK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1134"></A>
Acquire a shared lock on the file, as with <CODE>flock</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="libc_241.html#SEC248">File Locks</A>.

</P>
<P>
If <CODE>O_CREAT</CODE> is specified, the locking is done atomically when
creating the file.  You are guaranteed that no other process will get
the lock on the new file first.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>O_EXLOCK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1135"></A>
Acquire an exclusive lock on the file, as with <CODE>flock</CODE>.
See section <A HREF="libc_241.html#SEC248">File Locks</A>.  This is atomic like <CODE>O_SHLOCK</CODE>.
</DL>
