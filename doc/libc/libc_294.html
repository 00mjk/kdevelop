<H4><A NAME="SEC301" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC301">Host Address Data Type</A></H4>

<P>
IPv4 Internet host addresses are represented in some contexts as integers
(type <CODE>uint32_t</CODE>).  In other contexts, the integer is
packaged inside a structure of type <CODE>struct in_addr</CODE>.  It would
be better if the usage were made consistent, but it is not hard to extract
the integer from the structure or put the integer into a structure.

</P>
<P>
You will find older code that uses <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE> for
IPv4 Internet host addresses instead of <CODE>uint32_t</CODE> or <CODE>struct
in_addr</CODE>.  Historically <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE> was a 32 bit number but
with 64 bit machines this has changed.  Using <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE>
might break the code if it is used on machines where this type doesn't
have 32 bits.  <CODE>uint32_t</CODE> is specified by Unix98 and guaranteed to have
32 bits.

</P>
<P>
IPv6 Internet host addresses have 128 bits and are packaged inside a
structure of type <CODE>struct in6_addr</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The following basic definitions for Internet addresses are declared in
the header file <TT>`netinet/in.h'</TT>:
<A NAME="IDX1447"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>struct in_addr</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1448"></A>
This data type is used in certain contexts to contain an IPv4 Internet
host address.  It has just one field, named <CODE>s_addr</CODE>, which records
the host address number as an <CODE>uint32_t</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> uint32_t <B>INADDR_LOOPBACK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1449"></A>
You can use this constant to stand for "the address of this machine,"
instead of finding its actual address.  It is the IPv4 Internet address
<SAMP>`127.0.0.1'</SAMP>, which is usually called <SAMP>`localhost'</SAMP>.  This
special constant saves you the trouble of looking up the address of your
own machine.  Also, the system usually implements <CODE>INADDR_LOOPBACK</CODE>
specially, avoiding any network traffic for the case of one machine
talking to itself.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> uint32_t <B>INADDR_ANY</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1450"></A>
You can use this constant to stand for "any incoming address," when
binding to an address.  See section <A HREF="libc_283.html#SEC290">Setting the Address of a Socket</A>.  This is the usual
address to give in the <CODE>sin_addr</CODE> member of <CODE>struct
sockaddr_in</CODE> when you want to accept Internet connections.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> uint32_t <B>INADDR_BROADCAST</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1451"></A>
This constant is the address you use to send a broadcast message.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> uint32_t <B>INADDR_NONE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
This constant is returned by some functions to indicate an error.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>struct in6_addr</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
This data type is used to store an IPv6 address.  It stores 128 bits of
data, which can be accessed (via a union) in a variety of ways.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Constant:</U> struct in6_addr <B>in6addr_loopback</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1454"></A>
This constant is the IPv6 address <SAMP>`::1'</SAMP>, the loopback address.  See
above for a description of what this means.  The macro
<CODE>IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT</CODE> is provided to allow you to initialise your
own variables to this value.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Constant:</U> struct in6_addr <B>in6addr_any</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1455"></A>
This constant is the IPv6 address <SAMP>`::'</SAMP>, the unspecified address.  See
above for a description of what this means.  The macro
<CODE>IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT</CODE> is provided to allow you to initialise your
own variables to this value.
</DL>
