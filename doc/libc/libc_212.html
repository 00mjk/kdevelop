<H3><A NAME="SEC219" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC219">How to use <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> and <CODE>addseverity</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
Here is a simple example program to illustrate the use of the both
functions described in this section.

</P>

<PRE>
#include &#60;fmtmsg.h&#62;

int
main (void)
{
  addseverity (5, "NOTE2");
  fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "only1field", MM_INFO, "text2", "action2", "tag2");
  fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "UX:cat", 5, "invalid syntax", "refer to manual",
          "UX:cat:001");
  fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "label:foo", 6, "text", "action", "tag");
  return 0;
}
</PRE>

<P>
The second call to <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> illustrates a use of this function how
it usually happens on System V systems which heavily use this function.
It might be worth a thought to follow the scheme used in System V
systems so we give a short explanation here.  The value of the
<VAR>label</VAR> field (<CODE>UX:cat</CODE>) says that the error occurred in the
Unix program <CODE>cat</CODE>.  The explanation of the error follows and the
value for the <VAR>action</VAR> parameter is <CODE>"refer to manual"</CODE>.  One
could me more specific here, if needed.  The <VAR>tag</VAR> field contains,
as proposed above, the value of the string given for the <VAR>label</VAR>
parameter, and additionally a unique ID (<CODE>001</CODE> in this case).  For
a GNU environment this string could contain a reference to the
corresponding node in the Info page for the program.

</P>
<P>
Running this program without specifying the <CODE>MSGVERB</CODE> and
<CODE>SEV_LEVEL</CODE> function produces the following output:

</P>

<PRE>
UX:cat: NOTE2: invalid syntax
TO FIX: refer to manual UX:cat:001
</PRE>

<P>
We see the different fields of the message and how the extra glue (the
colons and the <CODE>TO FIX</CODE> string) are printed.  But only one of the
three calls to <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> produced output.  The first call does not
print anything because the <VAR>label</VAR> parameter is not in the correct
form.  The string must contain two fields, separated by a colon
(see section <A HREF="libc_210.html#SEC217">Printing Formatted Messages</A>).  The third <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> call
produced no output since the class with the numeric value <CODE>6</CODE> is
not defined.  Although a class with numeric value <CODE>5</CODE> is also not
defined by default, the call the <CODE>addseverity</CODE> introduces it and
the second call to <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> produces the above output.

</P>
<P>
When we change the environment of the program to contain
<CODE>SEV_LEVEL=XXX,6,NOTE</CODE> when running it we get a different result:

</P>

<PRE>
UX:cat: NOTE2: invalid syntax
TO FIX: refer to manual UX:cat:001
label:foo: NOTE: text
TO FIX: action tag
</PRE>

<P>
Now the third call the <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> produced some output and we see how
the string <CODE>NOTE</CODE> from the environment variable appears in the
message.

</P>
<P>
Now we can reduce the output by specifying in which fields we are
interested in.  If we additionally set the environment variable
<CODE>MSGVERB</CODE> to the value <CODE>severity:label:action</CODE> we get the
following output:

</P>

<PRE>
UX:cat: NOTE2
TO FIX: refer to manual
label:foo: NOTE
TO FIX: action
</PRE>

<P>
I.e., the output produced by the <VAR>text</VAR> and the <VAR>tag</VAR> parameters
to <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> vanished.  Please also note that now there is no colon
after the <CODE>NOTE</CODE> and <CODE>NOTE2</CODE> strings in the output.  This is
not necessary since there is no more output on this line since the text
is missing.
