When a signal is generated, it becomes <STRONG>pending</STRONG>.  Normally it
remains pending for just a short period of time and then is
<STRONG>delivered</STRONG> to the process that was signaled.  However, if that kind
of signal is currently <STRONG>blocked</STRONG>, it may remain pending
indefinitely--until signals of that kind are <STRONG>unblocked</STRONG>.  Once
unblocked, it will be delivered immediately.  See section <A HREF="libc_455.html#SEC462">Blocking Signals</A>.

<A NAME="IDX2431"></A>
When the signal is delivered, whether right away or after a long delay,
the <STRONG>specified action</STRONG> for that signal is taken.  For certain
signals, such as <CODE>SIGKILL</CODE> and <CODE>SIGSTOP</CODE>, the action is fixed,
but for most signals, the program has a choice: ignore the signal,
specify a <STRONG>handler function</STRONG>, or accept the <STRONG>default action</STRONG> for
that kind of signal.  The program specifies its choice using functions
such as <CODE>signal</CODE> or <CODE>sigaction</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_431.html#SEC438">Specifying Signal Actions</A>).  We
sometimes say that a handler <STRONG>catches</STRONG> the signal.  While the
handler is running, that particular signal is normally blocked.

</P>
<P>
If the specified action for a kind of signal is to ignore it, then any
such signal which is generated is discarded immediately.  This happens
even if the signal is also blocked at the time.  A signal discarded in
this way will never be delivered, not even if the program subsequently
specifies a different action for that kind of signal and then unblocks
it.

</P>
<P>
If a signal arrives which the program has neither handled nor ignored,
its <STRONG>default action</STRONG> takes place.  Each kind of signal has its own
default action, documented below (see section <A HREF="libc_422.html#SEC429">Standard Signals</A>).  For most kinds
of signals, the default action is to terminate the process.  For certain
kinds of signals that represent "harmless" events, the default action
is to do nothing.

</P>
<P>
When a signal terminates a process, its parent process can determine the
cause of termination by examining the termination status code reported
by the <CODE>wait</CODE> or <CODE>waitpid</CODE> functions.  (This is discussed in
more detail in section <A HREF="libc_518.html#SEC526">Process Completion</A>.)  The information it can get
includes the fact that termination was due to a signal, and the kind of
signal involved.  If a program you run from a shell is terminated by a
signal, the shell typically prints some kind of error message.

</P>
<P>
The signals that normally represent program errors have a special
property: when one of these signals terminates the process, it also
writes a <STRONG>core dump file</STRONG> which records the state of the process at
the time of termination.  You can examine the core dump with a debugger
to investigate what caused the error.

</P>
<P>
If you raise a "program error" signal by explicit request, and this
terminates the process, it makes a core dump file just as if the signal
had been due directly to an error.
