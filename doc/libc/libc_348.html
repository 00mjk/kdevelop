<H4><A NAME="SEC355" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC355">Other Special Characters</A></H4>

<P>
These special characters exist only in BSD systems and the GNU system.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>VLNEXT</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1740"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1741"></A>
This is the subscript for the LNEXT character in the special control
character array.  <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VLNEXT]</CODE> holds the character
itself.

</P>
<P>
The LNEXT character is recognized only when <CODE>IEXTEN</CODE> is set, but in
both canonical and noncanonical mode.  It disables any special
significance of the next character the user types.  Even if the
character would normally perform some editing function or generate a
signal, it is read as a plain character.  This is the analogue of the
<KBD>C-q</KBD> command in Emacs.  "LNEXT" stands for "literal next."

</P>
<P>
The LNEXT character is usually <KBD>C-v</KBD>.

<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>VDISCARD</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1742"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1743"></A>
This is the subscript for the DISCARD character in the special control
character array.  <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VDISCARD]</CODE> holds the character
itself.

</P>
<P>
The DISCARD character is recognized only when <CODE>IEXTEN</CODE> is set, but
in both canonical and noncanonical mode.  Its effect is to toggle the
discard-output flag.  When this flag is set, all program output is
discarded.  Setting the flag also discards all output currently in the
output buffer.  Typing any other character resets the flag.

<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>VSTATUS</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1744"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1745"></A>
This is the subscript for the STATUS character in the special control
character array.  <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VSTATUS]</CODE> holds the character
itself.

</P>
<P>
The STATUS character's effect is to print out a status message about how
the current process is running.

</P>
<P>
The STATUS character is recognized only in canonical mode, and only if
<CODE>NOKERNINFO</CODE> is not set.
