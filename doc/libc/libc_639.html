<P>
We recommend installing the following GNU tools before attempting to
build the GNU C library:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>make</CODE> 3.75

You need the latest version of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>.  Modifying the GNU C
Library to work with other <CODE>make</CODE> programs would be so difficult that we
recommend you port GNU <CODE>make</CODE> instead.  <STRONG>Really.</STRONG>  We
recommend version GNU <CODE>make</CODE> version 3.75 or 3.77.  All earlier
versions have severe bugs or lack features. Version 3.76 is known to
have bugs which only show up in big projects like GNU <CODE>libc</CODE>.
Version 3.76.1 seems OK but some people have reported problems.

<LI>

EGCS 1.1.1, 1.1 or 1.0.3, or GCC 2.8.1, 2.95 or newer

The GNU C library can only be compiled with the GNU C compiler family.
As of the 2.1 release, EGCS 1.0.3 or higher is required.  GCC 2.8.1 can
also be used (but see the FAQ for reasons why you might not want to).
Earlier versions simply are too buggy.  As of this writing, GCC 2.95.2
is the compiler we advise to use.

You can use whatever compiler you like to compile programs that use GNU
libc, but be aware that both GCC 2.7 and 2.8 have bugs in their
floating-point support that may be triggered by the math library.

On Alpha machines you need at least EGCS 1.1.1.  Earlier versions don't
work reliably.

For PPC you might need some patches even on top of the last EGCS version.
See the FAQ.

<LI>

GNU <CODE>binutils</CODE> 2.9.1, 2.9.1.0.16, or later 2.9.1.0.x release

You must use GNU binutils (as and ld) if you want to build a shared
library.  Even if you don't, we recommend you use them anyway.  No one
has tested compilation with non-GNU binutils in a long time.

The quality of binutils releases has varied a bit recently.  The bugs
are in obscure features, but glibc uses quite a few of those.  2.9.1,
2.9.1.0.16, and later 2.9.1.0.x releases are known to work.  Versions
after 2.8.1.0.23 may or may not work.  Older versions definitely don't.
2.9.1.0.16 or higher is required on some platforms, like PPC and Arm.

For PPC you might need some patches even on top of the last binutils
version.  See the FAQ.

<LI>

GNU <CODE>texinfo</CODE> 3.12f

To correctly translate and install the Texinfo documentation you need
this version of the <CODE>texinfo</CODE> package.  Earlier versions do not
understand all the tags used in the document, and the installation
mechanism for the info files is not present or works differently.

<LI>

GNU <CODE>awk</CODE> 3.0, or some other POSIX awk

Awk is used in several places to generate files.  The scripts should
work with any POSIX-compliant awk implementation; <CODE>gawk</CODE> 3.0 and
<CODE>mawk</CODE> 1.3 are known to work.

<LI>

Perl 5

Perl is not required, but it is used if present to test the
installation.  We may decide to use it elsewhere in the future.

</UL>

<P>
If you change any of the <TT>`configure.in'</TT> files you will also need

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>autoconf</CODE> 2.12 or higher
</UL>

<P>
and if you change any of the message translation files you will need

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

GNU <CODE>gettext</CODE> 0.10.35 or later (version 0.10.35 is a alpha release
and available via ftp from alpha.gnu.org/gnu)
</UL>

<P>
You may also need these packages if you upgrade your source tree using
patches, although we try to avoid this.
