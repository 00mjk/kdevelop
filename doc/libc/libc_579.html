Sometimes it is useful to group users according to other criteria
(see section <A HREF="libc_573.html#SEC581">Group Database</A>).  E.g., it is useful to associate a certain
group of users with a certain machine.  On the other hand grouping of
host names is not supported so far.

</P>
<P>
In Sun Microsystems SunOS appeared a new kind of database, the netgroup
database.  It allows to group hosts, users, and domain freely, giving
them individual names.  More concrete: a netgroup is a list of triples
consisting of a host name, a user name, and a domain name, where any of
the entries can be a wildcard entry, matching all inputs.  A last
possibility is that names of other netgroups can also be given in the
list specifying a netgroup.  So one can construct arbitrary hierarchies
without loops.

</P>
<P>
Sun's implementation allows netgroups only for the <CODE>nis</CODE> or
<CODE>nisplus</CODE> service see section <A HREF="libc_543.html#SEC551">Services in the NSS configuration File</A>.  The
implementation in the GNU C library has no such restriction.  An entry
in either of the input services must have the following form:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>groupname</VAR> ( <VAR>groupname</VAR> | <CODE>(</CODE><VAR>hostname</VAR><CODE>,</CODE><VAR>username</VAR><CODE>,</CODE><CODE>domainname</CODE><CODE>)</CODE> )+
</PRE>

<P>
Any of the fields in the triple can be empty which means anything
matches.  While describing the functions we will see that the opposite
case is useful as well.  I.e., there may be entries which will not
match any input.  For entries like a name consisting of the single
character <CODE>-</CODE> shall be used.
