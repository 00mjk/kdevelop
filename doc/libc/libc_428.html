<H3><A NAME="SEC435" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC435">Operation Error Signals</A></H3>

<P>
These signals are used to report various errors generated by an
operation done by the program.  They do not necessarily indicate a
programming error in the program, but an error that prevents an
operating system call from completing.  The default action for all of
them is to cause the process to terminate.

<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGPIPE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2500"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2501"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2502"></A>
Broken pipe.  If you use pipes or FIFOs, you have to design your
application so that one process opens the pipe for reading before
another starts writing.  If the reading process never starts, or
terminates unexpectedly, writing to the pipe or FIFO raises a
<CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> signal.  If <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> is blocked, handled or
ignored, the offending call fails with <CODE>EPIPE</CODE> instead.

</P>
<P>
Pipes and FIFO special files are discussed in more detail in section <A HREF="libc_273.html#SEC280">Pipes and FIFOs</A>.

</P>
<P>
Another cause of <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> is when you try to output to a socket
that isn't connected.  See section <A HREF="libc_313.html#SEC320">Sending Data</A>.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGLOST</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2503"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2504"></A>
Resource lost.  This signal is generated when you have an advisory lock
on an NFS file, and the NFS server reboots and forgets about your lock.

</P>
<P>
In the GNU system, <CODE>SIGLOST</CODE> is generated when any server program
dies unexpectedly.  It is usually fine to ignore the signal; whatever
call was made to the server that died just returns an error.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGXCPU</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2505"></A>
CPU time limit exceeded.  This signal is generated when the process
exceeds its soft resource limit on CPU time.  See section <A HREF="libc_411.html#SEC418">Limiting Resource Usage</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGXFSZ</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2506"></A>
File size limit exceeded.  This signal is generated when the process
attempts to extend a file so it exceeds the process's soft resource
limit on file size.  See section <A HREF="libc_411.html#SEC418">Limiting Resource Usage</A>.
