Blocking a signal means telling the operating system to hold it and
deliver it later.  Generally, a program does not block signals
indefinitely--it might as well ignore them by setting their actions to
<CODE>SIG_IGN</CODE>.  But it is useful to block signals briefly, to prevent
them from interrupting sensitive operations.  For instance:

<UL>
<LI>

You can use the <CODE>sigprocmask</CODE> function to block signals while you
modify global variables that are also modified by the handlers for these
signals.

<LI>

You can set <CODE>sa_mask</CODE> in your <CODE>sigaction</CODE> call to block
certain signals while a particular signal handler runs.  This way, the
signal handler can run without being interrupted itself by signals.
