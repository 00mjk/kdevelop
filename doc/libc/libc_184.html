<H3><A NAME="SEC191" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC191">Predefined <CODE>printf</CODE> Handlers</A></H3>

<P>
The GNU libc also contains a concrete and useful application of the
<CODE>printf</CODE> handler extension.  There are two functions available
which implement a special way to print floating-point numbers.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>printf_size</B> <I>(FILE *<VAR>fp</VAR>, const struct printf_info *<VAR>info</VAR>, const void *const *<VAR>args</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX866"></A>
Print a given floating point number as for the format <CODE>%f</CODE> except
that there is a postfix character indicating the divisor for the
number to make this less than 1000.  There are two possible divisors:
powers of 1024 or powers to 1000.  Which one is used depends on the
format character specified while registered this handler.  If the
character is of lower case, 1024 is used.  For upper case characters,
1000 is used.

</P>
<P>
The postfix tag corresponds to bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes,
etc.  The full table is:

</P>

<P>
The default precision is 3, i.e., 1024 is printed with a lower-case
format character as if it were <CODE>%.3fk</CODE> and will yield <CODE>1.000k</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Due to the requirements of <CODE>register_printf_function</CODE> we must also
provide the function which return information about the arguments.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>printf_size_info</B> <I>(const struct printf_info *<VAR>info</VAR>, size_t <VAR>n</VAR>, int *<VAR>argtypes</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX867"></A>
This function will return in <VAR>argtypes</VAR> the information about the
used parameters in the way the <CODE>vfprintf</CODE> implementation expects
it.  The format always takes one argument.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
To use these functions both functions must be registered with a call like

</P>

<PRE>
register_printf_function ('B', printf_size, printf_size_info);
</PRE>

<P>
Here we register the functions to print numbers as powers of 1000 since
the format character <CODE>'B'</CODE> is an upper-case character.  If we
would additionally use <CODE>'b'</CODE> in a line like

</P>

<PRE>
register_printf_function ('b', printf_size, printf_size_info);
</PRE>

<P>
we could also print using power of 1024.  Please note that all what is
different in these both lines in the format specifier.  The
<CODE>printf_size</CODE> function knows about the difference of low and upper
case format specifiers.

</P>
<P>
The use of <CODE>'B'</CODE> and <CODE>'b'</CODE> is no coincidence.  Rather it is
the preferred way to use this functionality since it is available on
some other systems also available using the format specifiers.
