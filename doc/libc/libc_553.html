Each user account on a computer system is identified by a <STRONG>user
name</STRONG> (or <STRONG>login name</STRONG>) and <STRONG>user ID</STRONG>.  Normally, each user name
has a unique user ID, but it is possible for several login names to have
the same user ID.  The user names and corresponding user IDs are stored
in a data base which you can access as described in section <A HREF="libc_568.html#SEC576">User Database</A>.

Users are classified in <STRONG>groups</STRONG>.  Each user name belongs to one
<STRONG>default group</STRONG> and may also belong to any number of
<STRONG>supplementary groups</STRONG>. Users who are members of the same group can
share resources (such as files) that are not accessible to users who are
not a member of that group.  Each group has a <STRONG>group name</STRONG> and
<STRONG>group ID</STRONG>.  See section <A HREF="libc_573.html#SEC581">Group Database</A>, for how to find information
about a group ID or group name.
