These are the disadvantages of <CODE>alloca</CODE> in comparison with
<CODE>malloc</CODE>:

<LI>

If you try to allocate more storage than the machine can provide, you
don't get a clean error message.  Instead you get a fatal signal like
the one you would get from an infinite recursion; probably a
segmentation violation (see section <A HREF="libc_423.html#SEC430">Program Error Signals</A>).

<LI>

Some non-GNU systems fail to support <CODE>alloca</CODE>, so it is less
portable.  However, a slower emulation of <CODE>alloca</CODE> written in C
is available for use on systems with this deficiency.
