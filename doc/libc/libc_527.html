When a controlling process terminates, its terminal becomes free and a
new session can be established on it.  (In fact, another user could log
in on the terminal.)  This could cause a problem if any processes from
the old session are still trying to use that terminal.

</P>
<P>
To prevent problems, process groups that continue running even after the
session leader has terminated are marked as <STRONG>orphaned process
groups</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
When a process group becomes an orphan, its processes are sent a
<CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal.  Ordinarily, this causes the processes to
terminate.  However, if a program ignores this signal or establishes a
handler for it (see section <A HREF="libc_417.html#SEC424">Signal Handling</A>), it can continue running as in
the orphan process group even after its controlling process terminates;
but it still cannot access the terminal any more.
