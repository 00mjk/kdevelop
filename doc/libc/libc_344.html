<H3><A NAME="SEC351" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC351">Special Characters</A></H3>

<P>
In canonical input, the terminal driver recognizes a number of special
characters which perform various control functions.  These include the
ERASE character (usually <KBD>DEL</KBD>) for editing input, and other editing
characters.  The INTR character (normally <KBD>C-c</KBD>) for sending a
<CODE>SIGINT</CODE> signal, and other signal-raising characters, may be
available in either canonical or noncanonical input mode.  All these
characters are described in this section.

</P>
<P>
The particular characters used are specified in the <CODE>c_cc</CODE> member
of the <CODE>struct termios</CODE> structure.  This member is an array; each
element specifies the character for a particular role.  Each element has
a symbolic constant that stands for the index of that element--for
example, <CODE>VINTR</CODE> is the index of the element that specifies the INTR
character, so storing <CODE>'='</CODE> in <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VINTR]</CODE>
specifies <SAMP>`='</SAMP> as the INTR character.

</P>

On some systems, you can disable a particular special character function
by specifying the value <CODE>_POSIX_VDISABLE</CODE> for that role.  This
value is unequal to any possible character code.  See section <A HREF="libc_596.html#SEC604">Optional Features in File Support</A>, for more information about how to tell whether the operating
system you are using supports <CODE>_POSIX_VDISABLE</CODE>.
