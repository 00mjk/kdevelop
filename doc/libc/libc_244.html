<H1><A NAME="SEC251" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC251">File System Interface</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the GNU C library's functions for manipulating
files.  Unlike the input and output functions (see section <A HREF="libc_155.html#SEC162">Input/Output on Streams</A>;
see section <A HREF="libc_213.html#SEC220">Low-Level Input/Output</A>), these functions are concerned with operating
on the files themselves, rather than on their contents.

</P>
<P>
Among the facilities described in this chapter are functions for
examining or modifying directories, functions for renaming and deleting
files, and functions for examining and setting file attributes such as
access permissions and modification times.
