<H3><A NAME="SEC199" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC199">Other Input Conversions</A></H3>

<P>
This section describes the miscellaneous input conversions.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`%p'</SAMP> conversion is used to read a pointer value.  It recognizes
the same syntax as is used by the <SAMP>`%p'</SAMP> output conversion for
<CODE>printf</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_173.html#SEC180">Other Output Conversions</A>); that is, a hexadecimal
number just as the <SAMP>`%x'</SAMP> conversion accepts.  The corresponding
argument should be of type <CODE>void **</CODE>; that is, the address of a
place to store a pointer.

</P>
<P>
The resulting pointer value is not guaranteed to be valid if it was not
originally written during the same program execution that reads it in.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP> conversion produces the number of characters read so far
by this call.  The corresponding argument should be of type <CODE>int *</CODE>.
This conversion works in the same way as the <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP> conversion for
<CODE>printf</CODE>; see section <A HREF="libc_173.html#SEC180">Other Output Conversions</A>, for an example.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP> conversion is the only mechanism for determining the
success of literal matches or conversions with suppressed assignments.
If the <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP> follows the locus of a matching failure, then no value
is stored for it since <CODE>scanf</CODE> returns before processing the
<SAMP>`%n'</SAMP>.  If you store <CODE>-1</CODE> in that argument slot before calling
<CODE>scanf</CODE>, the presence of <CODE>-1</CODE> after <CODE>scanf</CODE> indicates an
error occurred before the <SAMP>`%n'</SAMP> was reached.

</P>
<P>
Finally, the <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP> conversion matches a literal <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character
in the input stream, without using an argument.  This conversion does
not permit any flags, field width, or type modifier to be specified.
