<H3><A NAME="SEC151" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC151">Details of Tilde Expansion</A></H3>

<P>
It's a standard part of shell syntax that you can use <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> at the
beginning of a file name to stand for your own home directory.  You
can use <SAMP>`~<VAR>user</VAR>'</SAMP> to stand for <VAR>user</VAR>'s home directory.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Tilde expansion</STRONG> is the process of converting these abbreviations
to the directory names that they stand for.

</P>
<P>
Tilde expansion applies to the <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> plus all following characters up
to whitespace or a slash.  It takes place only at the beginning of a
word, and only if none of the characters to be transformed is quoted in
any way.

</P>
<P>
Plain <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> uses the value of the environment variable <CODE>HOME</CODE>
as the proper home directory name.  <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> followed by a user name
uses <CODE>getpwname</CODE> to look up that user in the user database, and
uses whatever directory is recorded there.  Thus, <SAMP>`~'</SAMP> followed
by your own name can give different results from plain <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>, if
the value of <CODE>HOME</CODE> is not really your home directory.
