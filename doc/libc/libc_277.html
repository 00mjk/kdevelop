<H2><A NAME="SEC284" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC284">Atomicity of Pipe I/O</A></H2>

<P>
Reading or writing pipe data is <STRONG>atomic</STRONG> if the size of data written
is not greater than <CODE>PIPE_BUF</CODE>.  This means that the data transfer
seems to be an instantaneous unit, in that nothing else in the system
can observe a state in which it is partially complete.  Atomic I/O may
not begin right away (it may need to wait for buffer space or for data),
but once it does begin, it finishes immediately.

</P>
<P>
Reading or writing a larger amount of data may not be atomic; for
example, output data from other processes sharing the descriptor may be
interspersed.  Also, once <CODE>PIPE_BUF</CODE> characters have been written,
further writes will block until some characters are read.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="libc_595.html#SEC603">Limits on File System Capacity</A>, for information about the <CODE>PIPE_BUF</CODE>
parameter.
