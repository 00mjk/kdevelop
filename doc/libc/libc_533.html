When a foreground process is launched, the shell must block until all of
the processes in that job have either terminated or stopped.  It can do
this by calling the <CODE>waitpid</CODE> function; see section <A HREF="libc_518.html#SEC526">Process Completion</A>.  Use the <CODE>WUNTRACED</CODE> option so that status is reported
for processes that stop as well as processes that terminate.

</P>
<P>
The shell must also check on the status of background jobs so that it
can report terminated and stopped jobs to the user; this can be done by
calling <CODE>waitpid</CODE> with the <CODE>WNOHANG</CODE> option.  A good place to
put a such a check for terminated and stopped jobs is just before
prompting for a new command.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2828"></A>
The shell can also receive asynchronous notification that there is
status information available for a child process by establishing a
handler for <CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE> signals.  See section <A HREF="libc_417.html#SEC424">Signal Handling</A>.

</P>
<P>
In the sample shell program, the <CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE> signal is normally
ignored.  This is to avoid reentrancy problems involving the global data
structures the shell manipulates.  But at specific times when the shell
is not using these data structures--such as when it is waiting for
input on the terminal--it makes sense to enable a handler for
<CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE>.  The same function that is used to do the synchronous
status checks (<CODE>do_job_notification</CODE>, in this case) can also be
called from within this handler.

</P>
<P>
Here are the parts of the sample shell program that deal with checking
the status of jobs and reporting the information to the user.
