<H2><A NAME="SEC634" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC634">Important Data Types</A></H2>

<P>
The result of subtracting two pointers in C is always an integer, but the
precise data type varies from C compiler to C compiler.  Likewise, the
data type of the result of <CODE>sizeof</CODE> also varies between compilers.
ISO defines standard aliases for these two types, so you can refer to
them in a portable fashion.  They are defined in the header file
<TT>`stddef.h'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX3232"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>ptrdiff_t</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3233"></A>
This is the signed integer type of the result of subtracting two
pointers.  For example, with the declaration <CODE>char *p1, *p2;</CODE>, the
expression <CODE>p2 - p1</CODE> is of type <CODE>ptrdiff_t</CODE>.  This will
probably be one of the standard signed integer types (<CODE>short
int</CODE>, <CODE>int</CODE> or <CODE>long int</CODE>), but might be a nonstandard
type that exists only for this purpose.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>size_t</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3234"></A>
This is an unsigned integer type used to represent the sizes of objects.
The result of the <CODE>sizeof</CODE> operator is of this type, and functions
such as <CODE>malloc</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_22.html#SEC22">Unconstrained Allocation</A>) and
<CODE>memcpy</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_67.html#SEC67">Copying and Concatenation</A>) accept arguments of
this type to specify object sizes.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Usage Note:</STRONG> <CODE>size_t</CODE> is the preferred way to declare any
arguments or variables that hold the size of an object.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
In the GNU system <CODE>size_t</CODE> is equivalent to either
<CODE>unsigned int</CODE> or <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE>.  These types
have identical properties on the GNU system, and for most purposes, you
can use them interchangeably.  However, they are distinct as data types,
which makes a difference in certain contexts.

</P>
<P>
For example, when you specify the type of a function argument in a
function prototype, it makes a difference which one you use.  If the
system header files declare <CODE>malloc</CODE> with an argument of type
<CODE>size_t</CODE> and you declare <CODE>malloc</CODE> with an argument of type
<CODE>unsigned int</CODE>, you will get a compilation error if <CODE>size_t</CODE>
happens to be <CODE>unsigned long int</CODE> on your system.  To avoid any
possibility of error, when a function argument or value is supposed to
have type <CODE>size_t</CODE>, never declare its type in any other way.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Compatibility Note:</STRONG> Implementations of C before the advent of
ISO C generally used <CODE>unsigned int</CODE> for representing object sizes
and <CODE>int</CODE> for pointer subtraction results.  They did not
necessarily define either <CODE>size_t</CODE> or <CODE>ptrdiff_t</CODE>.  Unix
systems did define <CODE>size_t</CODE>, in <TT>`sys/types.h'</TT>, but the
definition was usually a signed type.
