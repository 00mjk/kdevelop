<P>
The GNU C library is compatible with the C standard adopted by the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI):
<CITE>American National Standard X3.159-1989---"ANSI C"</CITE> and later
by the International Standardization Organization (ISO):
<CITE>ISO/IEC 9899:1990, "Programming languages--C"</CITE>.
We here refer to the standard as ISO C since this is the more
general standard in respect of ratification.
The header files and library facilities that make up the GNU library are
a superset of those specified by the ISO C standard.

If you are concerned about strict adherence to the ISO C standard, you
should use the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option when you compile your programs with
the GNU C compiler.  This tells the compiler to define <EM>only</EM> ISO
standard features from the library header files, unless you explicitly
ask for additional features.  See section <A HREF="libc_13.html#SEC13">Feature Test Macros</A>, for
information on how to do this.

</P>
<P>
Being able to restrict the library to include only ISO C features is
important because ISO C puts limitations on what names can be defined
by the library implementation, and the GNU extensions don't fit these
limitations.  See section <A HREF="libc_12.html#SEC12">Reserved Names</A>, for more information about these
restrictions.

</P>
<P>
This manual does not attempt to give you complete details on the
differences between ISO C and older dialects.  It gives advice on how
to write programs to work portably under multiple C dialects, but does
not aim for completeness.
