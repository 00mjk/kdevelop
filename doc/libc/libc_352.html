A <STRONG>pseudo-terminal</STRONG> is a special interprocess communication channel
that acts like a terminal.  One end of the channel is called the
<STRONG>master</STRONG> side or <STRONG>master pseudo-terminal device</STRONG>, the other side
is called the <STRONG>slave</STRONG> side.  Data written to the master side is
received by the slave side as if it was the result of a user typing at
an ordinary terminal, and data written to the slave side is sent to the
master side as if it was written on an ordinary terminal.

<P>
Pseudo terminals are the way programs like <CODE>xterm</CODE> and <CODE>emacs</CODE>
implement their terminal emulation functionality.
