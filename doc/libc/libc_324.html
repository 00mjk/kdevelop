<H2><A NAME="SEC331" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC331">The <CODE>inetd</CODE> Daemon</A></H2>

<P>
We've explained above how to write a server program that does its own
listening.  Such a server must already be running in order for anyone
to connect to it.

</P>
<P>
Another way to provide service for an Internet port is to let the daemon
program <CODE>inetd</CODE> do the listening.  <CODE>inetd</CODE> is a program that
runs all the time and waits (using <CODE>select</CODE>) for messages on a
specified set of ports.  When it receives a message, it accepts the
connection (if the socket style calls for connections) and then forks a
child process to run the corresponding server program.  You specify the
ports and their programs in the file <TT>`/etc/inetd.conf'</TT>.
