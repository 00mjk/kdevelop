<H1><A NAME="SEC621" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC621">C Language Facilities in the Library</A></H1>

<P>
Some of the facilities implemented by the C library really should be
thought of as parts of the C language itself.  These facilities ought to
be documented in the C Language Manual, not in the library manual; but
since we don't have the language manual yet, and documentation for these
features has been written, we are publishing it here.
