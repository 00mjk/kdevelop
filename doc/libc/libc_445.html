<H3><A NAME="SEC452" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC452">Atomic Data Access and Signal Handling</A></H3>

<P>
Whether the data in your application concerns atoms, or mere text, you
have to be careful about the fact that access to a single datum is not
necessarily <STRONG>atomic</STRONG>.  This means that it can take more than one
instruction to read or write a single object.  In such cases, a signal
handler might in the middle of reading or writing the object.

</P>
<P>
There are three ways you can cope with this problem.  You can use data
types that are always accessed atomically; you can carefully arrange
that nothing untoward happens if an access is interrupted, or you can
block all signals around any access that had better not be interrupted
(see section <A HREF="libc_455.html#SEC462">Blocking Signals</A>).
