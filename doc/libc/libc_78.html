<H2><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC78">Overview about Character Handling Functions</A></H2>

<P>
A Unix C library contains three different sets of functions in two
families to handle character set conversion.  The one function family
is specified in the ISO C standard and therefore is portable even
beyond the Unix world.

</P>
<P>
The most commonly known set of functions, coming from the ISO C89
standard, is unfortunately the least useful one.  In fact, these
functions should be avoided whenever possible, especially when
developing libraries (as opposed to applications).

</P>
<P>
The second family of functions got introduced in the early Unix standards
(XPG2) and is still part of the latest and greatest Unix standard:
Unix 98.  It is also the most powerful and useful set of functions.
But we will start with the functions defined in the second amendment to
ISO C89.
