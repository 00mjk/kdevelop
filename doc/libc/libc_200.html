<H3><A NAME="SEC207" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC207">Buffering Concepts</A></H3>

<P>
There are three different kinds of buffering strategies:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

Characters written to or read from an <STRONG>unbuffered</STRONG> stream are
transmitted individually to or from the file as soon as possible.
<A NAME="IDX919"></A>

<LI>

Characters written to a <STRONG>line buffered</STRONG> stream are transmitted to
the file in blocks when a newline character is encountered.
<A NAME="IDX920"></A>

<LI>

Characters written to or read from a <STRONG>fully buffered</STRONG> stream are
transmitted to or from the file in blocks of arbitrary size.
<A NAME="IDX921"></A>
</UL>

<P>
Newly opened streams are normally fully buffered, with one exception: a
stream connected to an interactive device such as a terminal is
initially line buffered.  See section <A HREF="libc_202.html#SEC209">Controlling Which Kind of Buffering</A>, for information
on how to select a different kind of buffering.  Usually the automatic
selection gives you the most convenient kind of buffering for the file
or device you open.

</P>
<P>
The use of line buffering for interactive devices implies that output
messages ending in a newline will appear immediately--which is usually
what you want.  Output that doesn't end in a newline might or might not
show up immediately, so if you want them to appear immediately, you
should flush buffered output explicitly with <CODE>fflush</CODE>, as described
in section <A HREF="libc_201.html#SEC208">Flushing Buffers</A>.
