<P>
This chapter describes both functions that work on arbitrary arrays or
blocks of memory, and functions that are specific to null-terminated
arrays of characters.

</P>
<P>
Functions that operate on arbitrary blocks of memory have names
beginning with <SAMP>`mem'</SAMP> (such as <CODE>memcpy</CODE>) and invariably take an
argument which specifies the size (in bytes) of the block of memory to
operate on.  The array arguments and return values for these functions
have type <CODE>void *</CODE>, and as a matter of style, the elements of these
arrays are referred to as "bytes".  You can pass any kind of pointer
to these functions, and the <CODE>sizeof</CODE> operator is useful in
computing the value for the size argument.

</P>
<P>
In contrast, functions that operate specifically on strings have names
beginning with <SAMP>`str'</SAMP> (such as <CODE>strcpy</CODE>) and look for a null
character to terminate the string instead of requiring an explicit size
argument to be passed.  (Some of these functions accept a specified
maximum length, but they also check for premature termination with a
null character.)  The array arguments and return values for these
functions have type <CODE>char *</CODE>, and the array elements are referred
to as "characters".

</P>
<P>
In many cases, there are both <SAMP>`mem'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`str'</SAMP> versions of a
function.  The one that is more appropriate to use depends on the exact
situation.  When your program is manipulating arbitrary arrays or blocks of
storage, then you should always use the <SAMP>`mem'</SAMP> functions.  On the
other hand, when you are manipulating null-terminated strings it is
usually more convenient to use the <SAMP>`str'</SAMP> functions, unless you
already know the length of the string in advance.
