<P>
This chapter describes the GNU facilities for interprocess
communication using sockets.

A <STRONG>socket</STRONG> is a generalized interprocess communication channel.
Like a pipe, a socket is represented as a file descriptor.  But,
unlike pipes, sockets support communication between unrelated
processes, and even between processes running on different machines
that communicate over a network.  Sockets are the primary means of
communicating with other machines; <CODE>telnet</CODE>, <CODE>rlogin</CODE>,
<CODE>ftp</CODE>, <CODE>talk</CODE>, and the other familiar network programs use
sockets.

</P>
<P>
Not all operating systems support sockets.  In the GNU library, the
header file <TT>`sys/socket.h'</TT> exists regardless of the operating
system, and the socket functions always exist, but if the system does
not really support sockets, these functions always fail.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Incomplete:</STRONG> We do not currently document the facilities for
broadcast messages or for configuring Internet interfaces.  The
reentrant functions and some newer functions that are related to IPv6
aren't documented either so far.
