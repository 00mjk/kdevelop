<P>
<A NAME="IDX1560"></A>
The <CODE>send</CODE> function is declared in the header file
<TT>`sys/socket.h'</TT>.  If your <VAR>flags</VAR> argument is zero, you can just
as well use <CODE>write</CODE> instead of <CODE>send</CODE>; see section <A HREF="libc_216.html#SEC223">Input and Output Primitives</A>.  If the socket was connected but the connection has broken,
you get a <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> signal for any use of <CODE>send</CODE> or
<CODE>write</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_429.html#SEC436">Miscellaneous Signals</A>).

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>send</B> <I>(int <VAR>socket</VAR>, void *<VAR>buffer</VAR>, size_t <VAR>size</VAR>, int <VAR>flags</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1561"></A>
The <CODE>send</CODE> function is like <CODE>write</CODE>, but with the additional
flags <VAR>flags</VAR>.  The possible values of <VAR>flags</VAR> are described
in section <A HREF="libc_315.html#SEC322">Socket Data Options</A>.

</P>
<P>
This function returns the number of bytes transmitted, or <CODE>-1</CODE> on
failure.  If the socket is nonblocking, then <CODE>send</CODE> (like
<CODE>write</CODE>) can return after sending just part of the data.
See section <A HREF="libc_236.html#SEC243">File Status Flags</A>, for information about nonblocking mode.

</P>
<P>
Note, however, that a successful return value merely indicates that
the message has been sent without error, not necessarily that it has
been received without error.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>errno</CODE> error conditions are defined for this function:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>EBADF</CODE>
<DD>
The <VAR>socket</VAR> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

<DT><CODE>EINTR</CODE>
<DD>
The operation was interrupted by a signal before any data was sent.
See section <A HREF="libc_449.html#SEC456">Primitives Interrupted by Signals</A>.

<DT><CODE>ENOTSOCK</CODE>
<DD>
The descriptor <VAR>socket</VAR> is not a socket.

<DT><CODE>EMSGSIZE</CODE>
<DD>
The socket type requires that the message be sent atomically, but the
message is too large for this to be possible.

<DT><CODE>EWOULDBLOCK</CODE>
<DD>
Nonblocking mode has been set on the socket, and the write operation
would block.  (Normally <CODE>send</CODE> blocks until the operation can be
completed.)

<DT><CODE>ENOBUFS</CODE>
<DD>
There is not enough internal buffer space available.

<DT><CODE>ENOTCONN</CODE>
<DD>
You never connected this socket.

<DT><CODE>EPIPE</CODE>
<DD>
This socket was connected but the connection is now broken.  In this
case, <CODE>send</CODE> generates a <CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> signal first; if that
signal is ignored or blocked, or if its handler returns, then
<CODE>send</CODE> fails with <CODE>EPIPE</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
This function is defined as a cancelation point in multi-threaded
programs.  So one has to be prepared for this and make sure that
possibly allocated resources (like memory, files descriptors,
semaphores or whatever) are freed even if the thread is canceled.
