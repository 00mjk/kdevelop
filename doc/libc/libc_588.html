<H2><A NAME="SEC596" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC596">Overall System Options</A></H2>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX3093"></A>

</P>
<P>
POSIX defines certain system-specific options that not all POSIX systems
support.  Since these options are provided in the kernel, not in the
library, simply using the GNU C library does not guarantee any of these
features is supported; it depends on the system you are using.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX3094"></A>
You can test for the availability of a given option using the macros in
this section, together with the function <CODE>sysconf</CODE>.  The macros are
defined only if you include <TT>`unistd.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
For the following macros, if the macro is defined in <TT>`unistd.h'</TT>,
then the option is supported.  Otherwise, the option may or may not be
supported; use <CODE>sysconf</CODE> to find out.  See section <A HREF="libc_590.html#SEC598">Using <CODE>sysconf</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX_JOB_CONTROL</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3095"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system supports job
control.  Otherwise, the implementation behaves as if all processes
within a session belong to a single process group.  See section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX_SAVED_IDS</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3096"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system remembers the
effective user and group IDs of a process before it executes an
executable file with the set-user-ID or set-group-ID bits set, and that
explicitly changing the effective user or group IDs back to these values
is permitted.  If this option is not defined, then if a nonprivileged
process changes its effective user or group ID to the real user or group
ID of the process, it can't change it back again.  See section <A HREF="libc_560.html#SEC568">Enabling and Disabling Setuid Access</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
For the following macros, if the macro is defined in <TT>`unistd.h'</TT>,
then its value indicates whether the option is supported.  A value of
<CODE>-1</CODE> means no, and any other value means yes.  If the macro is not
defined, then the option may or may not be supported; use <CODE>sysconf</CODE>
to find out.  See section <A HREF="libc_590.html#SEC598">Using <CODE>sysconf</CODE></A>.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX2_C_DEV</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3097"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the POSIX.2
C compiler command, <CODE>c89</CODE>.  The GNU C library always defines this
as <CODE>1</CODE>, on the assumption that you would not have installed it if
you didn't have a C compiler.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX2_FORT_DEV</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3098"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the POSIX.2
Fortran compiler command, <CODE>fort77</CODE>.  The GNU C library never
defines this, because we don't know what the system has.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX2_FORT_RUN</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3099"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the POSIX.2
<CODE>asa</CODE> command to interpret Fortran carriage control.  The GNU C
library never defines this, because we don't know what the system has.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX2_LOCALEDEF</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3100"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the POSIX.2
<CODE>localedef</CODE> command.  The GNU C library never defines this, because
we don't know what the system has.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>_POSIX2_SW_DEV</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX3101"></A>
If this symbol is defined, it indicates that the system has the POSIX.2
commands <CODE>ar</CODE>, <CODE>make</CODE>, and <CODE>strip</CODE>.  The GNU C library
always defines this as <CODE>1</CODE>, on the assumption that you had to have
<CODE>ar</CODE> and <CODE>make</CODE> to install the library, and it's unlikely that
<CODE>strip</CODE> would be absent when those are present.
