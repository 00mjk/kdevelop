<P>
These signals are used to indicate the expiration of timers.
See section <A HREF="libc_408.html#SEC415">Setting an Alarm</A>, for information about functions that cause
these signals to be sent.

</P>
<P>
The default behavior for these signals is to cause program termination.
This default is rarely useful, but no other default would be useful;
most of the ways of using these signals would require handler functions
in any case.

<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGALRM</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2474"></A>
This signal typically indicates expiration of a timer that measures real
or clock time.  It is used by the <CODE>alarm</CODE> function, for example.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX2475"></A>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGVTALRM</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2476"></A>
This signal typically indicates expiration of a timer that measures CPU
time used by the current process.  The name is an abbreviation for
"virtual time alarm".
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX2477"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>SIGPROF</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2478"></A>
This signal is typically indicates expiration of a timer that measures
both CPU time used by the current process, and CPU time expended on
behalf of the process by the system.  Such a timer is used to implement
code profiling facilities, hence the name of this signal.
