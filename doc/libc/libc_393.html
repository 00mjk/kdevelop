<H2><A NAME="SEC400" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC400">Processor Time</A></H2>

<P>
If you're trying to optimize your program or measure its efficiency, it's
very useful to be able to know how much <STRONG>processor time</STRONG> or <STRONG>CPU
time</STRONG> it has used at any given point.  Processor time is different from
actual wall clock time because it doesn't include any time spent waiting
for I/O or when some other process is running.  Processor time is
represented by the data type <CODE>clock_t</CODE>, and is given as a number of
<STRONG>clock ticks</STRONG> relative to an arbitrary base time marking the beginning
of a single program invocation.
