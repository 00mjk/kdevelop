<H2><A NAME="SEC522" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC522">Process Creation Concepts</A></H2>

<P>
This section gives an overview of processes and of the steps involved in
creating a process and making it run another program.

Each process is named by a <STRONG>process ID</STRONG> number.  A unique process ID
is allocated to each process when it is created.  The <STRONG>lifetime</STRONG> of
a process ends when its termination is reported to its parent process;
at that time, all of the process resources, including its process ID,
are freed.

Processes are created with the <CODE>fork</CODE> system call (so the operation
of creating a new process is sometimes called <STRONG>forking</STRONG> a process).
The <STRONG>child process</STRONG> created by <CODE>fork</CODE> is a copy of the original
<STRONG>parent process</STRONG>, except that it has its own process ID.

</P>
<P>
After forking a child process, both the parent and child processes
continue to execute normally.  If you want your program to wait for a
child process to finish executing before continuing, you must do this
explicitly after the fork operation, by calling <CODE>wait</CODE> or
<CODE>waitpid</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_518.html#SEC526">Process Completion</A>).  These functions give you
limited information about why the child terminated--for example, its
exit status code.

</P>
<P>
A newly forked child process continues to execute the same program as
its parent process, at the point where the <CODE>fork</CODE> call returns.
You can use the return value from <CODE>fork</CODE> to tell whether the program
is running in the parent process or the child.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2764"></A>
Having several processes run the same program is only occasionally
useful.  But the child can execute another program using one of the
<CODE>exec</CODE> functions; see section <A HREF="libc_517.html#SEC525">Executing a File</A>.  The program that the
process is executing is called its <STRONG>process image</STRONG>.  Starting
execution of a new program causes the process to forget all about its
previous process image; when the new program exits, the process exits
too, instead of returning to the previous process image.
