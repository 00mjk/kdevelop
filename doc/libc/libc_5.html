The GNU library is also compatible with the ISO <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG> family of
standards, known more formally as the <STRONG>Portable Operating System
Interface for Computer Environments</STRONG> (ISO/IEC 9945).  They were also
published as ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.  POSIX is derived mostly from various
versions of the Unix operating system.

</P>
<P>
The library facilities specified by the POSIX standards are a superset
of those required by ISO C; POSIX specifies additional features for
ISO C functions, as well as specifying new additional functions.  In
general, the additional requirements and functionality defined by the
POSIX standards are aimed at providing lower-level support for a
particular kind of operating system environment, rather than general
programming language support which can run in many diverse operating
system environments.
</P>
<P>
The GNU C library implements all of the functions specified in
<CITE>ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996, the POSIX System Application Program
Interface</CITE>, commonly referred to as POSIX.1.  The primary extensions to
the ISO C facilities specified by this standard include file system
interface primitives (see section <A HREF="libc_244.html#SEC251">File System Interface</A>), device-specific
terminal control functions (see section <A HREF="libc_331.html#SEC338">Low-Level Terminal Interface</A>), and
process control functions (see section <A HREF="libc_512.html#SEC520">Processes</A>).

</P>
<P>
Some facilities from <CITE>ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993, the POSIX Shell and
Utilities standard</CITE> (POSIX.2) are also implemented in the GNU library.
These include utilities for dealing with regular expressions and other
pattern matching facilities (see section <A HREF="libc_126.html#SEC133">Pattern Matching</A>).
