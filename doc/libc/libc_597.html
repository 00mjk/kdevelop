<H2><A NAME="SEC605" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC605">Minimum Values for File System Limits</A></H2>

<P>
Here are the names for the POSIX minimum upper bounds for some of the
above parameters.  The significance of these values is that you can
safely push to these limits without checking whether the particular
system you are using can go that far.  In most cases GNU systems do not
have these strict limitations.  The actual limit should be requested if
necessary.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_LINK_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum value of a
file's link count.  The value of this constant is <CODE>8</CODE>; thus, you
can always make up to eight names for a file without running into a
system limit.

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_MAX_CANON</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum number of
bytes in a canonical input line from a terminal device.  The value of
this constant is <CODE>255</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_MAX_INPUT</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum number of
bytes in a terminal device input queue (or typeahead buffer).
See section <A HREF="libc_339.html#SEC346">Input Modes</A>.  The value of this constant is <CODE>255</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_NAME_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum number of
bytes in a file name component.  The value of this constant is
<CODE>14</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_PATH_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum number of
bytes in a file name.  The value of this constant is <CODE>255</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>_POSIX_PIPE_BUF</CODE>
<DD>
The most restrictive limit permitted by POSIX for the maximum number of
bytes that can be written atomically to a pipe.  The value of this
constant is <CODE>512</CODE>.
