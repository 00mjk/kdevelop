<H3><A NAME="SEC426" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC426">Some Kinds of Signals</A></H3>

<P>
A signal reports the occurrence of an exceptional event.  These are some
of the events that can cause (or <STRONG>generate</STRONG>, or <STRONG>raise</STRONG>) a
signal:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A program error such as dividing by zero or issuing an address outside
the valid range.

<LI>

A user request to interrupt or terminate the program.  Most environments
are set up to let a user suspend the program by typing <KBD>C-z</KBD>, or
terminate it with <KBD>C-c</KBD>.  Whatever key sequence is used, the
operating system sends the proper signal to interrupt the process.

<LI>

The termination of a child process.

<LI>

Expiration of a timer or alarm.

<LI>

A call to <CODE>kill</CODE> or <CODE>raise</CODE> by the same process.

<LI>

A call to <CODE>kill</CODE> from another process.  Signals are a limited but
useful form of interprocess communication.

<LI>

An attempt to perform an I/O operation that cannot be done.  Examples
are reading from a pipe that has no writer (see section <A HREF="libc_273.html#SEC280">Pipes and FIFOs</A>),
and reading or writing to a terminal in certain situations (see section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>).
</UL>

<P>
Each of these kinds of events (excepting explicit calls to <CODE>kill</CODE>
and <CODE>raise</CODE>) generates its own particular kind of signal.  The
various kinds of signals are listed and described in detail in
section <A HREF="libc_422.html#SEC429">Standard Signals</A>.
