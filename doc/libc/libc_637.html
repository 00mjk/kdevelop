GNU libc can be compiled in the source directory, but we strongly advise to
build it in a separate build directory.  For example, if you have unpacked
the glibc sources in <TT>`/src/gnu/glibc-2.1.0'</TT>, create a directory
<TT>`/src/gnu/glibc-build'</TT> to put the object files in.  This allows to
remove the whole build directory in case an error occurs which is the
safest way to get a clean way and should always be done.

</P>
<P>
From your object directory, run the shell script <TT>`configure'</TT> found
at the top level of the source tree.  In the scenario above, you'd type

</P>

<PRE>
$ ../glibc-2.1.0/configure <VAR>args...</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
Please note that even if you're building in a separate build directory,
the compilation needs to modify a few files in the source
directory, especially some files in the manual subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>configure</CODE> takes many options, but you can get away with knowing
only two: <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`--enable-add-ons'</SAMP>.  The
<CODE>--prefix</CODE> option tells configure where you want glibc installed.
This defaults to <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.  The <SAMP>`--enable-add-ons'</SAMP> option
tells configure to use all the add-on bundles it finds in the source
directory.  Since important functionality is provided in add-ons, you
should always specify this option.

</P>
<P>
It may also be useful to set the <VAR>CC</VAR> and <VAR>CFLAGS</VAR> variables in
the environment when running <CODE>configure</CODE>.  <VAR>CC</VAR> selects the C
compiler that will be used, and <VAR>CFLAGS</VAR> sets optimization options
for the compiler.

</P>
<P>
The following list describes all of the available options for <CODE>configure</CODE>:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`--prefix=<VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Install machine-independent data files in subdirectories of
<TT>`<VAR>directory</VAR>'</TT>.  The default is to install in <TT>`/usr/local'</TT>.

<DT><SAMP>`--exec-prefix=<VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Install the library and other machine-dependent files in subdirectories
of <TT>`<VAR>directory</VAR>'</TT>.  The default is to the <SAMP>`--prefix'</SAMP>
directory if that option is specified, or <TT>`/usr/local'</TT> otherwise.

<DT><SAMP>`--with-headers=<VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Look for kernel header files in <VAR>directory</VAR>, not
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.  Glibc needs information from the kernel's private
header files.  It will normally look in <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> for them,
but if you specify this option, it will look in <VAR>DIRECTORY</VAR> instead.

This option is primarily of use on a system where the headers in
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT> come from an older version of glibc.  Conflicts can
occasionally happen in this case.  Note that Linux libc5 qualifies as an
older version of glibc.  You can also use this option if you want to
compile glibc with a newer set of kernel headers than the ones found in
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT>.

<DT><SAMP>`--enable-add-ons[=<VAR>list</VAR>]'</SAMP>
<DD>
Enable add-on packages in your source tree.  If this option is specified
with no list, it enables all the add-on packages it finds.  If you do
not wish to use some add-on package that you have present in your source
tree, give this option a list of the add-ons that you <EM>do</EM> want
used, like this: <SAMP>`--enable-add-ons=crypt,linuxthreads'</SAMP>

<DT><SAMP>`--with-binutils=<VAR>directory</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
Use the binutils (assembler and linker) in <TT>`<VAR>directory</VAR>'</TT>, not
the ones the C compiler would default to.  You could use this option if
the default binutils on your system cannot deal with all the constructs
in the GNU C library.  In that case, <CODE>configure</CODE> will detect the problem and
suppress these constructs, so that the library will still be usable, but
functionality may be lost--for example, you can't build a shared libc
with old binutils.

<DT><SAMP>`--without-fp'</SAMP>
<DD>
Use this option if your computer lacks hardware floating-point support
and your operating system does not emulate an FPU.

<DT><SAMP>`--disable-shared'</SAMP>
<DD>
Don't build shared libraries even if it is possible.  Not all systems support
shared libraries; you need ELF support and (currently) the GNU linker.

<DT><SAMP>`--disable-profile'</SAMP>
<DD>
Don't build libraries with profiling information.  You may want to use
this option if you don't plan to do profiling.

<DT><SAMP>`--enable-omitfp'</SAMP>
<DD>
Use maximum optimization for the normal (static and shared)
libraries, and compile separate static libraries with debugging
information and no optimisation.  We recommend against this.  The extra
optimization doesn't gain you much, it may provoke compiler bugs, and
you won't be able to trace bugs through the C library.

<DT><SAMP>`--disable-versioning'</SAMP>
<DD>
Don't compile the shared libraries with symbol version information.
Doing this will make the resulting library incompatible with old
binaries, so it's not recommended.

<DT><SAMP>`--enable-static-nss'</SAMP>
<DD>
Compile static versions of the NSS (Name Service Switch) libraries.
This is not recommended because it defeats the purpose of NSS; a program
linked statically with the NSS libraries cannot be dynamically
reconfigured to use a different name database.

<DT><SAMP>`--build=<VAR>build-system</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
<DT><SAMP>`--host=<VAR>host-system</VAR>'</SAMP>
<DD>
These options are for cross-compiling.  If you specify both options and
<VAR>build-system</VAR> is different from <VAR>host-system</VAR>, <CODE>configure</CODE>
will prepare to cross-compile glibc from <VAR>build-system</VAR> to be used
on <VAR>host-system</VAR>.  You'll probably need the <SAMP>`--with-headers'</SAMP>
option too, and you may have to override <VAR>configure</VAR>'s selection of
the compiler and/or binutils.

If you only specify <SAMP>`--host'</SAMP>, configure will prepare for a native
compile but use what you specify instead of guessing what your system is.
This is most useful to change the CPU submodel.  For example, if
configure guesses your machine as <CODE>i586-pc-linux-gnu</CODE> but you want
to compile a library for 386es, give <SAMP>`--host=i386-pc-linux-gnu'</SAMP> or
just <SAMP>`--host=i386-linux'</SAMP> and add the appropriate compiler flags
(<SAMP>`-mcpu=i386'</SAMP> will do the trick) to <VAR>CFLAGS</VAR>.

If you specify just <SAMP>`--build'</SAMP>, configure will get confused.
</DL>

<P>
To build the library and related programs, type <CODE>make</CODE>.  This will
produce a lot of output, some of which may look like errors from
<CODE>make</CODE> but isn't.  Look for error messages from <CODE>make</CODE>
containing <SAMP>`***'</SAMP>.  Those indicate that something is really wrong.

</P>
<P>
The compilation process takes several hours even on fast hardware.
Expect at least two hours for the default configuration on i586 for
Linux.  For Hurd times are much longer.  Except for EGCS 1.1 and GCC
2.95 (and later versions of GCC), all supported versions of GCC have a
problem which causes them to take several minutes to compile certain
files in the iconvdata directory.  Do not panic if the compiler appears
to hang.

</P>
<P>
If you want to run a parallel make, you can't just give <CODE>make</CODE> the
<SAMP>`-j'</SAMP> option, because it won't be passed down to the sub-makes.
Instead, edit the generated <TT>`Makefile'</TT> and uncomment the line

</P>

<PRE>
# PARALLELMFLAGS = -j 4
</PRE>

<P>
You can change the <SAMP>`4'</SAMP> to some other number as appropriate for
your system.  Instead of changing the <TT>`Makefile'</TT>, you could give
this option directly to <CODE>make</CODE> and call it as, for example,
<CODE>make PARALLELMFLAGS=-j4</CODE>.  If you're building in the source
directory, you must use the latter approach since in this case no
new <TT>`Makefile'</TT> is generated for you to change.

</P>
<P>
To build and run test programs which exercise some of the library
facilities, type <CODE>make check</CODE>.  If it does not complete
successfully, do not use the built library, and report a bug after
verifying that the problem is not already known.  See section <A HREF="libc_642.html#SEC650">Reporting Bugs</A>,
for instructions on reporting bugs.  Note that some of the tests assume
they are not being run by <CODE>root</CODE>.  We recommend you compile and
test glibc as an unprivileged user.

</P>
<P>
To format the <CITE>GNU C Library Reference Manual</CITE> for printing, type
<CODE>make dvi</CODE>.  You need a working TeX installation to do this.
The distribution already includes the on-line formatted version of the
manual, as Info files.  You can regenerate those with <CODE>make
info</CODE>, but it shouldn't be necessary.

</P>
<P>
The library has a number of special-purpose configuration parameters
which you can find in <TT>`Makeconfig'</TT>.  These can be overwritten with
the file <TT>`configparms'</TT>.  To change them, create a
<TT>`configparms'</TT> in your build directory and add values as appropriate
for your system.  The file is included and parsed by <CODE>make</CODE> and has
to follow the conventions for makefiles.

</P>
<P>
It is easy to configure the GNU C library for cross-compilation by
setting a few variables in <TT>`configparms'</TT>.  Set <CODE>CC</CODE> to the
cross-compiler for the target you configured the library for; it is
important to use this same <CODE>CC</CODE> value when running
<CODE>configure</CODE>, like this: <SAMP>`CC=<VAR>target</VAR>-gcc configure
<VAR>target</VAR>'</SAMP>.  Set <CODE>BUILD_CC</CODE> to the compiler to use for for
programs run on the build system as part of compiling the library.  You
may need to set <CODE>AR</CODE> and <CODE>RANLIB</CODE> to cross-compiling versions
of <CODE>ar</CODE> and <CODE>ranlib</CODE> if the native tools are not configured to
work with object files for the target you configured for.
