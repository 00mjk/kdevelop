A <STRONG>pipe</STRONG> is a mechanism for interprocess communication; data written
to the pipe by one process can be read by another process.  The data is
handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.  The pipe has no name; it
is created for one use and both ends must be inherited from the single
process which created the pipe.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1369"></A>
A <STRONG>FIFO special file</STRONG> is similar to a pipe, but instead of being an
anonymous, temporary connection, a FIFO has a name or names like any
other file.  Processes open the FIFO by name in order to communicate
through it.

</P>
<P>
A pipe or FIFO has to be open at both ends simultaneously.  If you read
from a pipe or FIFO file that doesn't have any processes writing to it
(perhaps because they have all closed the file, or exited), the read
returns end-of-file.  Writing to a pipe or FIFO that doesn't have a
reading process is treated as an error condition; it generates a
<CODE>SIGPIPE</CODE> signal, and fails with error code <CODE>EPIPE</CODE> if the
signal is handled or blocked.

</P>
<P>
Neither pipes nor FIFO special files allow file positioning.  Both
reading and writing operations happen sequentially; reading from the
beginning of the file and writing at the end.
