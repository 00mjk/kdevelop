<H4><A NAME="SEC354" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC354">Special Characters for Flow Control</A></H4>

<P>
These special characters may be active in either canonical or noncanonical
input mode, but their use is controlled by the flags <CODE>IXON</CODE> and
<CODE>IXOFF</CODE> (see section <A HREF="libc_339.html#SEC346">Input Modes</A>).

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>VSTART</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1736"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1737"></A>
This is the subscript for the START character in the special control
character array.  <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VSTART]</CODE> holds the
character itself.

</P>
<P>
The START character is used to support the <CODE>IXON</CODE> and <CODE>IXOFF</CODE>
input modes.  If <CODE>IXON</CODE> is set, receiving a START character resumes
suspended output; the START character itself is discarded.  If
<CODE>IXANY</CODE> is set, receiving any character at all resumes suspended
output; the resuming character is not discarded unless it is the START
character.  <CODE>IXOFF</CODE> is set, the system may also transmit START
characters to the terminal.

</P>
<P>
The usual value for the START character is <KBD>C-q</KBD>.  You may not be
able to change this value--the hardware may insist on using <KBD>C-q</KBD>
regardless of what you specify.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>VSTOP</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1738"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1739"></A>
This is the subscript for the STOP character in the special control
character array.  <CODE><VAR>termios</VAR>.c_cc[VSTOP]</CODE> holds the character
itself.

</P>
<P>
The STOP character is used to support the <CODE>IXON</CODE> and <CODE>IXOFF</CODE>
input modes.  If <CODE>IXON</CODE> is set, receiving a STOP character causes
output to be suspended; the STOP character itself is discarded.  If
<CODE>IXOFF</CODE> is set, the system may also transmit STOP characters to the
terminal, to prevent the input queue from overflowing.

</P>
<P>
The usual value for the STOP character is <KBD>C-s</KBD>.  You may not be
able to change this value--the hardware may insist on using <KBD>C-s</KBD>
regardless of what you specify.
