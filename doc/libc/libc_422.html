This section lists the names for various standard kinds of signals and
describes what kind of event they mean.  Each signal name is a macro
which stands for a positive integer--the <STRONG>signal number</STRONG> for that
kind of signal.  Your programs should never make assumptions about the
numeric code for a particular kind of signal, but rather refer to them
always by the names defined here.  This is because the number for a
given kind of signal can vary from system to system, but the meanings of
the names are standardized and fairly uniform.

</P>
<P>
The signal names are defined in the header file <TT>`signal.h'</TT>.

<DT><U>Macro:</U> int <B>NSIG</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2436"></A>
The value of this symbolic constant is the total number of signals
defined.  Since the signal numbers are allocated consecutively,
<CODE>NSIG</CODE> is also one greater than the largest defined signal number.
