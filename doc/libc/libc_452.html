The <CODE>kill</CODE> function can be used to send a signal to another process.
In spite of its name, it can be used for a lot of things other than
causing a process to terminate.  Some examples of situations where you
might want to send signals between processes are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

A parent process starts a child to perform a task--perhaps having the
child running an infinite loop--and then terminates the child when the
task is no longer needed.

<LI>

A process executes as part of a group, and needs to terminate or notify
the other processes in the group when an error or other event occurs.

<LI>

Two processes need to synchronize while working together.
</UL>

<P>
This section assumes that you know a little bit about how processes
work.  For more information on this subject, see section <A HREF="libc_512.html#SEC520">Processes</A>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>kill</CODE> function is declared in <TT>`signal.h'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX2565"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>kill</B> <I>(pid_t <VAR>pid</VAR>, int <VAR>signum</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2566"></A>
The <CODE>kill</CODE> function sends the signal <VAR>signum</VAR> to the process
or process group specified by <VAR>pid</VAR>.  Besides the signals listed in
section <A HREF="libc_422.html#SEC429">Standard Signals</A>, <VAR>signum</VAR> can also have a value of zero to
check the validity of the <VAR>pid</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The <VAR>pid</VAR> specifies the process or process group to receive the
signal:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE><VAR>pid</VAR> &#62; 0</CODE>
<DD>
The process whose identifier is <VAR>pid</VAR>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>pid</VAR> == 0</CODE>
<DD>
All processes in the same process group as the sender.

<DT><CODE><VAR>pid</VAR> &#60; -1</CODE>
<DD>
The process group whose identifier is -<VAR>pid</VAR>.

<DT><CODE><VAR>pid</VAR> == -1</CODE>
<DD>
If the process is privileged, send the signal to all processes except
for some special system processes.  Otherwise, send the signal to all
processes with the same effective user ID.
</DL>

<P>
A process can send a signal to itself with a call like <CODE>kill
(getpid(), <VAR>signum</VAR>)</CODE>.  If <CODE>kill</CODE> is used by a process to send
a signal to itself, and the signal is not blocked, then <CODE>kill</CODE>
delivers at least one signal (which might be some other pending
unblocked signal instead of the signal <VAR>signum</VAR>) to that process
before it returns.

</P>
<P>
The return value from <CODE>kill</CODE> is zero if the signal can be sent
successfully.  Otherwise, no signal is sent, and a value of <CODE>-1</CODE> is
returned.  If <VAR>pid</VAR> specifies sending a signal to several processes,
<CODE>kill</CODE> succeeds if it can send the signal to at least one of them.
There's no way you can tell which of the processes got the signal
or whether all of them did.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>errno</CODE> error conditions are defined for this function:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>EINVAL</CODE>
<DD>
The <VAR>signum</VAR> argument is an invalid or unsupported number.

<DT><CODE>EPERM</CODE>
<DD>
You do not have the privilege to send a signal to the process or any of
the processes in the process group named by <VAR>pid</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>ESCRH</CODE>
<DD>
The <VAR>pid</VAR> argument does not refer to an existing process or group.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>killpg</B> <I>(int <VAR>pgid</VAR>, int <VAR>signum</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2567"></A>
This is similar to <CODE>kill</CODE>, but sends signal <VAR>signum</VAR> to the
process group <VAR>pgid</VAR>.  This function is provided for compatibility
with BSD; using <CODE>kill</CODE> to do this is more portable.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
As a simple example of <CODE>kill</CODE>, the call <CODE>kill (getpid (),
<VAR>sig</VAR>)</CODE> has the same effect as <CODE>raise (<VAR>sig</VAR>)</CODE>.
