This section describes how to write a signal handler function that can
be established with the <CODE>signal</CODE> or <CODE>sigaction</CODE> functions.

</P>
<P>
A signal handler is just a function that you compile together with the
rest of the program.  Instead of directly invoking the function, you use
<CODE>signal</CODE> or <CODE>sigaction</CODE> to tell the operating system to call
it when a signal arrives.  This is known as <STRONG>establishing</STRONG> the
handler.  See section <A HREF="libc_431.html#SEC438">Specifying Signal Actions</A>.

</P>
<P>
There are two basic strategies you can use in signal handler functions:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

You can have the handler function note that the signal arrived by
tweaking some global data structures, and then return normally.

<LI>

You can have the handler function terminate the program or transfer
control to a point where it can recover from the situation that caused
the signal.
</UL>

<P>
You need to take special care in writing handler functions because they
can be called asynchronously.  That is, a handler might be called at any
point in the program, unpredictably.  If two signals arrive during a
very short interval, one handler can run within another.  This section
describes what your handler should do, and what you should avoid.
