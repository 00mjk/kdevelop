<H4><A NAME="SEC454" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC454">Atomic Types</A></H4>

<P>
To avoid uncertainty about interrupting access to a variable, you can
use a particular data type for which access is always atomic:
<CODE>sig_atomic_t</CODE>.  Reading and writing this data type is guaranteed
to happen in a single instruction, so there's no way for a handler to
run "in the middle" of an access.

</P>
<P>
The type <CODE>sig_atomic_t</CODE> is always an integer data type, but which
one it is, and how many bits it contains, may vary from machine to
machine.

</P>

<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>sig_atomic_t</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2552"></A>
This is an integer data type.  Objects of this type are always accessed
atomically.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
In practice, you can assume that <CODE>int</CODE> and other integer types no
longer than <CODE>int</CODE> are atomic.  You can also assume that pointer
types are atomic; that is very convenient.  Both of these are true on
all of the machines that the GNU C library supports, and on all POSIX
systems we know of.
