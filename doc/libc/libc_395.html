<H3><A NAME="SEC402" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC402">Detailed Elapsed CPU Time Inquiry</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>times</CODE> function returns more detailed information about
elapsed processor time in a <CODE>struct tms</CODE> object.  You should
include the header file <TT>`sys/times.h'</TT> to use this facility.
<A NAME="IDX2295"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Data Type:</U> <B>struct tms</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2296"></A>
The <CODE>tms</CODE> structure is used to return information about process
times.  It contains at least the following members:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>clock_t tms_utime</CODE>
<DD>
This is the CPU time used in executing the instructions of the calling
process.

<DT><CODE>clock_t tms_stime</CODE>
<DD>
This is the CPU time used by the system on behalf of the calling process.

<DT><CODE>clock_t tms_cutime</CODE>
<DD>
This is the sum of the <CODE>tms_utime</CODE> values and the <CODE>tms_cutime</CODE>
values of all terminated child processes of the calling process, whose
status has been reported to the parent process by <CODE>wait</CODE> or
<CODE>waitpid</CODE>; see section <A HREF="libc_518.html#SEC526">Process Completion</A>.  In other words, it
represents the total CPU time used in executing the instructions of all
the terminated child processes of the calling process, excluding child
processes which have not yet been reported by <CODE>wait</CODE> or
<CODE>waitpid</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>clock_t tms_cstime</CODE>
<DD>
This is similar to <CODE>tms_cutime</CODE>, but represents the total CPU time
used by the system on behalf of all the terminated child processes of the
calling process.
</DL>

<P>
All of the times are given in clock ticks.  These are absolute values; in a
newly created process, they are all zero.  See section <A HREF="libc_516.html#SEC524">Creating a Process</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> clock_t <B>times</B> <I>(struct tms *<VAR>buffer</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2297"></A>
The <CODE>times</CODE> function stores the processor time information for
the calling process in <VAR>buffer</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The return value is the same as the value of <CODE>clock()</CODE>: the elapsed
real time relative to an arbitrary base.  The base is a constant within a
particular process, and typically represents the time since system
start-up.  A value of <CODE>(clock_t)(-1)</CODE> is returned to indicate failure.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Portability Note:</STRONG> The <CODE>clock</CODE> function described in
section <A HREF="libc_394.html#SEC401">Basic CPU Time Inquiry</A>, is specified by the ISO C standard.  The
<CODE>times</CODE> function is a feature of POSIX.1.  In the GNU system, the
value returned by the <CODE>clock</CODE> function is equivalent to the sum of
the <CODE>tms_utime</CODE> and <CODE>tms_stime</CODE> fields returned by
<CODE>times</CODE>.
