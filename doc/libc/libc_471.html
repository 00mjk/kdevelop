<STRONG>Processes</STRONG> are the primitive units for allocation of system
resources.  Each process has its own address space and (usually) one
thread of control.  A process executes a program; you can have multiple
processes executing the same program, but each process has its own copy
of the program within its own address space and executes it
independently of the other copies.

<P>
This chapter explains what your program should do to handle the startup
of a process, to terminate its process, and to receive information
(arguments and the environment) from the parent process.
