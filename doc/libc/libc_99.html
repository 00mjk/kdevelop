<H2><A NAME="SEC103" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC103">Standard Locales</A></H2>

<P>
The only locale names you can count on finding on all operating systems
are these three standard ones:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>"C"</CODE>
<DD>
This is the standard C locale.  The attributes and behavior it provides
are specified in the ISO C standard.  When your program starts up, it
initially uses this locale by default.

<DT><CODE>"POSIX"</CODE>
<DD>
This is the standard POSIX locale.  Currently, it is an alias for the
standard C locale.

<DT><CODE>""</CODE>
<DD>
The empty name says to select a locale based on environment variables.
See section <A HREF="libc_97.html#SEC101">Categories of Activities that Locales Affect</A>.
</DL>

<P>
Defining and installing named locales is normally a responsibility of
the system administrator at your site (or the person who installed the
GNU C library).  It is also possible for the user to create private
locales.  All this will be discussed later when describing the tool to
do so XXX.

</P>
<P>
If your program needs to use something other than the <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale,
it will be more portable if you use whatever locale the user specifies
with the environment, rather than trying to specify some non-standard
locale explicitly by name.  Remember, different machines might have
different sets of locales installed.
