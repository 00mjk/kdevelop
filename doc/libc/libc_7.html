<P>
The <STRONG>System V Interface Description</STRONG> (SVID) is a document describing
the AT&#38;T Unix System V operating system.  It is to some extent a
superset of the POSIX standard (see section <A HREF="libc_5.html#SEC5">POSIX (The Portable Operating System Interface)</A>).

</P>
<P>
The GNU C library defines most of the facilities required by the SVID
that are not also required by the ISO C or POSIX standards, for
compatibility with  System V Unix and other Unix systems (such as
SunOS) which include these facilities.  However, many of the more
obscure and less generally useful facilities required by the SVID are
not included.  (In fact, Unix System V itself does not provide them all.)

</P>
<P>
The supported facilities from System V include the methods for
inter-process communication and shared memory, the <CODE>hsearch</CODE> and
<CODE>drand48</CODE> families of functions, <CODE>fmtmsg</CODE> and several of the
mathematical functions.
