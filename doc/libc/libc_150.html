<H2><A NAME="SEC157" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC157">File Names</A></H2>

<P>
In order to open a connection to a file, or to perform other operations
such as deleting a file, you need some way to refer to the file.  Nearly
all files have names that are strings--even files which are actually
devices such as tape drives or terminals.  These strings are called
<STRONG>file names</STRONG>.  You specify the file name to say which file you want
to open or operate on.

</P>
<P>
This section describes the conventions for file names and how the
operating system works with them.
