Go to the <A HREF="libc_1.html">first</A>, <A HREF="libc_341.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="libc_343.html">next</A>, <A HREF="libc_654.html">last</A> section, <A HREF="libc_toc.html">table of contents</A>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC349" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC349">Local Modes</A></H3>

<P>
This section describes the flags for the <CODE>c_lflag</CODE> member of the
<CODE>struct termios</CODE> structure.  These flags generally control
higher-level aspects of input processing than the input modes flags
described in section <A HREF="libc_339.html#SEC346">Input Modes</A>, such as echoing, signals, and the choice
of canonical or noncanonical input.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>c_lflag</CODE> member itself is an integer, and you change the flags
and fields using the operators <CODE>&#38;</CODE>, <CODE>|</CODE>, and <CODE>^</CODE>.  Don't
try to specify the entire value for <CODE>c_lflag</CODE>---instead, change
only specific flags and leave the rest untouched (see section <A HREF="libc_338.html#SEC345">Setting Terminal Modes Properly</A>).

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ICANON</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1660"></A>
This bit, if set, enables canonical input processing mode.  Otherwise,
input is processed in noncanonical mode.  See section <A HREF="libc_334.html#SEC341">Two Styles of Input: Canonical or Not</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHO</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1661"></A>
If this bit is set, echoing of input characters back to the terminal
is enabled.
<A NAME="IDX1662"></A>
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHOE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1663"></A>
If this bit is set, echoing indicates erasure of input with the ERASE
character by erasing the last character in the current line from the
screen.  Otherwise, the character erased is re-echoed to show what has
happened (suitable for a printing terminal).

</P>
<P>
This bit only controls the display behavior; the <CODE>ICANON</CODE> bit by
itself controls actual recognition of the ERASE character and erasure of
input, without which <CODE>ECHOE</CODE> is simply irrelevant.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHOPRT</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1664"></A>
This bit is like <CODE>ECHOE</CODE>, enables display of the ERASE character in
a way that is geared to a hardcopy terminal.  When you type the ERASE
character, a <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character is printed followed by the first
character erased.  Typing the ERASE character again just prints the next
character erased.  Then, the next time you type a normal character, a
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> character is printed before the character echoes.

</P>
<P>
This is a BSD extension, and exists only in BSD systems and the
GNU system.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHOK</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1665"></A>
This bit enables special display of the KILL character by moving to a
new line after echoing the KILL character normally.  The behavior of
<CODE>ECHOKE</CODE> (below) is nicer to look at.

</P>
<P>
If this bit is not set, the KILL character echoes just as it would if it
were not the KILL character.  Then it is up to the user to remember that
the KILL character has erased the preceding input; there is no
indication of this on the screen.

</P>
<P>
This bit only controls the display behavior; the <CODE>ICANON</CODE> bit by
itself controls actual recognition of the KILL character and erasure of
input, without which <CODE>ECHOK</CODE> is simply irrelevant.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHOKE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1666"></A>
This bit is similar to <CODE>ECHOK</CODE>.  It enables special display of the
KILL character by erasing on the screen the entire line that has been
killed.  This is a BSD extension, and exists only in BSD systems and the
GNU system.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHONL</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1667"></A>
If this bit is set and the <CODE>ICANON</CODE> bit is also set, then the
newline (<CODE>'\n'</CODE>) character is echoed even if the <CODE>ECHO</CODE> bit
is not set.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ECHOCTL</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1668"></A>
If this bit is set and the <CODE>ECHO</CODE> bit is also set, echo control
characters with <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> followed by the corresponding text character.
Thus, control-A echoes as <SAMP>`^A'</SAMP>.  This is usually the preferred mode
for interactive input, because echoing a control character back to the
terminal could have some undesired effect on the terminal.

</P>
<P>
This is a BSD extension, and exists only in BSD systems and the
GNU system.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ISIG</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1669"></A>
This bit controls whether the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters are
recognized.  The functions associated with these characters are performed
if and only if this bit is set.  Being in canonical or noncanonical
input mode has no affect on the interpretation of these characters.

</P>
<P>
You should use caution when disabling recognition of these characters.
Programs that cannot be interrupted interactively are very
user-unfriendly.  If you clear this bit, your program should provide
some alternate interface that allows the user to interactively send the
signals associated with these characters, or to escape from the program.
<A NAME="IDX1670"></A>

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="libc_346.html#SEC353">Characters that Cause Signals</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>IEXTEN</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1671"></A>
POSIX.1 gives <CODE>IEXTEN</CODE> implementation-defined meaning,
so you cannot rely on this interpretation on all systems.

</P>
<P>
On BSD systems and the GNU system, it enables the LNEXT and DISCARD characters.
See section <A HREF="libc_348.html#SEC355">Other Special Characters</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>NOFLSH</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1672"></A>
Normally, the INTR, QUIT, and SUSP characters cause input and output
queues for the terminal to be cleared.  If this bit is set, the queues
are not cleared.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>TOSTOP</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1673"></A>
If this bit is set and the system supports job control, then
<CODE>SIGTTOU</CODE> signals are generated by background processes that
attempt to write to the terminal.  See section <A HREF="libc_526.html#SEC534">Access to the Controlling Terminal</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
The following bits are BSD extensions; they exist only in BSD systems
and the GNU system.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>ALTWERASE</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1674"></A>
This bit determines how far the WERASE character should erase.  The
WERASE character erases back to the beginning of a word; the question
is, where do words begin?

</P>
<P>
If this bit is clear, then the beginning of a word is a nonwhitespace
character following a whitespace character.  If the bit is set, then the
beginning of a word is an alphanumeric character or underscore following
a character which is none of those.

</P>
<P>
See section <A HREF="libc_345.html#SEC352">Characters for Input Editing</A>, for more information about the WERASE character.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>FLUSHO</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1675"></A>
This is the bit that toggles when the user types the DISCARD character.
While this bit is set, all output is discarded.  See section <A HREF="libc_348.html#SEC355">Other Special Characters</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>NOKERNINFO</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1676"></A>
Setting this bit disables handling of the STATUS character.
See section <A HREF="libc_348.html#SEC355">Other Special Characters</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Macro:</U> tcflag_t <B>PENDIN</B>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1677"></A>
If this bit is set, it indicates that there is a line of input that
needs to be reprinted.  Typing the REPRINT character sets this bit; the
bit remains set until reprinting is finished.  See section <A HREF="libc_345.html#SEC352">Characters for Input Editing</A>.
</DL>
