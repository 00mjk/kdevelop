<H1><A NAME="SEC220" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC220">Low-Level Input/Output</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes functions for performing low-level input/output
operations on file descriptors.  These functions include the primitives
for the higher-level I/O functions described in section <A HREF="libc_155.html#SEC162">Input/Output on Streams</A>, as
well as functions for performing low-level control operations for which
there are no equivalents on streams.

</P>
<P>
Stream-level I/O is more flexible and usually more convenient;
therefore, programmers generally use the descriptor-level functions only
when necessary.  These are some of the usual reasons:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For reading binary files in large chunks.

<LI>

For reading an entire file into core before parsing it.

<LI>

To perform operations other than data transfer, which can only be done
with a descriptor.  (You can use <CODE>fileno</CODE> to get the descriptor
corresponding to a stream.)

<LI>

To pass descriptors to a child process.  (The child can create its own
stream to use a descriptor that it inherits, but cannot inherit a stream
directly.)
