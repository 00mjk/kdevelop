<H4><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC108">Printing the Sign of an Amount of Money</A></H4>

<P>
These members of the <CODE>struct lconv</CODE> structure specify how to print
the sign (if any) in a monetary value.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>char *positive_sign</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char *negative_sign</CODE>
<DD>
These are strings used to indicate positive (or zero) and negative
(respectively) monetary quantities.

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both of these members have a value of
<CODE>""</CODE> (the empty string), meaning "unspecified".

The ISO standard doesn't say what to do when you find this value; we
recommend printing <CODE>positive_sign</CODE> as you find it, even if it is
empty.  For a negative value, print <CODE>negative_sign</CODE> as you find it
unless both it and <CODE>positive_sign</CODE> are empty, in which case print
<SAMP>`-'</SAMP> instead.  (Failing to indicate the sign at all seems rather
unreasonable.)

<DT><CODE>char p_sign_posn</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char n_sign_posn</CODE>
<DD>
These members have values that are small integers indicating how to
position the sign for nonnegative and negative monetary quantities,
respectively.  (The string used by the sign is what was specified with
<CODE>positive_sign</CODE> or <CODE>negative_sign</CODE>.)  The possible values are
as follows:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>0</CODE>
<DD>
The currency symbol and quantity should be surrounded by parentheses.

<DT><CODE>1</CODE>
<DD>
Print the sign string before the quantity and currency symbol.

<DT><CODE>2</CODE>
<DD>
Print the sign string after the quantity and currency symbol.

<DT><CODE>3</CODE>
<DD>
Print the sign string right before the currency symbol.

<DT><CODE>4</CODE>
<DD>
Print the sign string right after the currency symbol.

<DT><CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
"Unspecified".  Both members have this value in the standard
<SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale.
</DL>

The ISO standard doesn't say what you should do when the value is
<CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>.  We recommend you print the sign after the currency
symbol.
</DL>

<P>
It is not clear whether you should let these members apply to the
international currency format or not.  POSIX says you should, but
intuition plus the examples in the ISO C standard suggest you should
not.  We hope that someone who knows well the conventions for formatting
monetary quantities will tell us what we should recommend.
