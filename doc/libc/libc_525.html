<H2><A NAME="SEC533" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC533">Controlling Terminal of a Process</A></H2>

<P>
One of the attributes of a process is its controlling terminal.  Child
processes created with <CODE>fork</CODE> inherit the controlling terminal from
their parent process.  In this way, all the processes in a session
inherit the controlling terminal from the session leader.  A session
leader that has control of a terminal is called the <STRONG>controlling
process</STRONG> of that terminal.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2812"></A>
You generally do not need to worry about the exact mechanism used to
allocate a controlling terminal to a session, since it is done for you
by the system when you log in.

</P>
<P>
An individual process disconnects from its controlling terminal when it
calls <CODE>setsid</CODE> to become the leader of a new session.
See section <A HREF="libc_538.html#SEC546">Process Group Functions</A>.
