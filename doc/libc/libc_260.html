When you issue an <SAMP>`ls -l'</SAMP> shell command on a file, it gives you
information about the size of the file, who owns it, when it was last
modified, and the like.  This kind of information is called the
<STRONG>file attributes</STRONG>; it is associated with the file itself and not a
particular one of its names.

</P>
<P>
This section contains information about how you can inquire about and
modify these attributes of files.
