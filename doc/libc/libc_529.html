<H3><A NAME="SEC537" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC537">Data Structures for the Shell</A></H3>

<P>
All of the program examples included in this chapter are part of
a simple shell program.  This section presents data structures
and utility functions which are used throughout the example.

</P>
<P>
The sample shell deals mainly with two data structures.  The
<CODE>job</CODE> type contains information about a job, which is a
set of subprocesses linked together with pipes.  The <CODE>process</CODE> type
holds information about a single subprocess.  Here are the relevant
data structure declarations:

</P>

<PRE>
/* A process is a single process.  */
typedef struct process
{
  struct process *next;       /* next process in pipeline */
  char **argv;                /* for exec */
  pid_t pid;                  /* process ID */
  char completed;             /* true if process has completed */
  char stopped;               /* true if process has stopped */
  int status;                 /* reported status value */
} process;

/* A job is a pipeline of processes.  */
typedef struct job
{
  struct job *next;           /* next active job */
  char *command;              /* command line, used for messages */
  process *first_process;     /* list of processes in this job */
  pid_t pgid;                 /* process group ID */
  char notified;              /* true if user told about stopped job */
  struct termios tmodes;      /* saved terminal modes */
  int stdin, stdout, stderr;  /* standard i/o channels */
} job;

/* The active jobs are linked into a list.  This is its head.   */
job *first_job = NULL;
</PRE>

<P>
Here are some utility functions that are used for operating on <CODE>job</CODE>
objects.

</P>

<PRE>
/* Find the active job with the indicated <VAR>pgid</VAR>.  */
job *
find_job (pid_t pgid)
{
  job *j;

  for (j = first_job; j; j = j-&#62;next)
    if (j-&#62;pgid == pgid)
      return j;
  return NULL;
}

/* Return true if all processes in the job have stopped or completed.  */
int
job_is_stopped (job *j)
{
  process *p;

  for (p = j-&#62;first_process; p; p = p-&#62;next)
    if (!p-&#62;completed &#38;&#38; !p-&#62;stopped)
      return 0;
  return 1;
}

/* Return true if all processes in the job have completed.  */
int
job_is_completed (job *j)
{
  process *p;

  for (p = j-&#62;first_process; p; p = p-&#62;next)
    if (!p-&#62;completed)
      return 0;
  return 1;
}
