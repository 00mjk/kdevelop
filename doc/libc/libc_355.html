<P>
This chapter contains information about functions for performing
mathematical computations, such as trigonometric functions.  Most of
these functions have prototypes declared in the header file
<TT>`math.h'</TT>.  The complex-valued functions are defined in
<TT>`complex.h'</TT>.

<P>
All mathematical functions which take a floating-point argument
have three variants, one each for <CODE>double</CODE>, <CODE>float</CODE>, and
<CODE>long double</CODE> arguments.  The <CODE>double</CODE> versions are mostly
defined in ISO C 89.  The <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>long double</CODE>
versions are from the numeric extensions to C included in ISO C 9X.

</P>
<P>
Which of the three versions of a function should be used depends on the
situation.  For most calculations, the <CODE>float</CODE> functions are the
fastest.  On the other hand, the <CODE>long double</CODE> functions have the
highest precision.  <CODE>double</CODE> is somewhere in between.  It is
usually wise to pick the narrowest type that can accommodate your data.
Not all machines have a distinct <CODE>long double</CODE> type; it may be the
same as <CODE>double</CODE>.
