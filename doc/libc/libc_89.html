<H2><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC89">Generic Charset Conversion</A></H2>

<P>
The conversion functions mentioned so far in this chapter all had in
common that they operate on character sets which are not directly
specified by the functions.  The multibyte encoding used is specified by
the currently selected locale for the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> category.  The
wide character set is fixed by the implementation (in the case of GNU C
library it always is UCS4 encoded ISO 10646.

</P>
<P>
This has of course several problems when it comes to general character
conversion:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

For every conversion where neither the source or destination character
set is the character set of the locale for the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> category,
one has to change the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> locale using <CODE>setlocale</CODE>.

This introduces major problems for the rest of the programs since
several more functions (e.g., the character classification functions,
see section <A HREF="libc_58.html#SEC58">Classification of Characters</A>) use the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> category.

<LI>

Parallel conversions to and from different character sets are not
possible since the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> selection is global and shared by all
threads.

<LI>

If neither the source nor the destination character set is the character
set used for <CODE>wchar_t</CODE> representation there is at least a two-step
process necessary to convert a text using the functions above.  One
would have to select the source character set as the multibyte encoding,
convert the text into a <CODE>wchar_t</CODE> text, select the destination
character set as the multibyte encoding and convert the wide character
text to the multibyte (@math{=} destination) character set.

Even if this is possible (which is not guaranteed) it is a very tiring
work.  Plus it suffers from the other two raised points even more due to
the steady changing of the locale.
</UL>

<P>
The XPG2 standard defines a completely new set of functions which has
none of these limitations.  They are not at all coupled to the selected
locales and they but no constraints on the character sets selected for
source and destination.  Only the set of available conversions is
limiting them.  The standard does not specify that any conversion at all
must be available.  It is a measure of the quality of the implementation.

</P>
<P>
In the following text first the interface to <CODE>iconv</CODE>, the
conversion function, will be described.  Comparisons with other
implementations will show what pitfalls lie on the way of portable
applications.  At last, the implementation is described as far as
interesting to the advanced user who wants to extend the conversion
capabilities.
