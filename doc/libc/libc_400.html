<H3><A NAME="SEC407" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC407">Formatting Date and Time</A></H3>

<P>
The functions described in this section format time values as strings.
These functions are declared in the header file <TT>`time.h'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX2327"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>asctime</B> <I>(const struct tm *<VAR>brokentime</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2328"></A>
The <CODE>asctime</CODE> function converts the broken-down time value that
<VAR>brokentime</VAR> points to into a string in a standard format:

</P>

<PRE>
"Tue May 21 13:46:22 1991\n"
</PRE>

<P>
The abbreviations for the days of week are: <SAMP>`Sun'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Mon'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`Tue'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Wed'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Thu'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Fri'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`Sat'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The abbreviations for the months are: <SAMP>`Jan'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Feb'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`Mar'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Apr'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`May'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Jun'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Jul'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Aug'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`Sep'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Oct'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`Nov'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`Dec'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The return value points to a statically allocated string, which might be
overwritten by subsequent calls to <CODE>asctime</CODE> or <CODE>ctime</CODE>.
(But no other library function overwrites the contents of this
string.)
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>asctime_r</B> <I>(const struct tm *<VAR>brokentime</VAR>, char *<VAR>buffer</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2329"></A>
This function is similar to <CODE>asctime</CODE> but instead of placing the
result in a static buffer it writes the string in the buffer pointed to
by the parameter <VAR>buffer</VAR>.  This buffer should have at least room
for 16 bytes.

</P>
<P>
If no error occurred the function returns a pointer to the string the
result was written into, i.e., it returns <VAR>buffer</VAR>.  Otherwise
return <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>ctime</B> <I>(const time_t *<VAR>time</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2330"></A>
The <CODE>ctime</CODE> function is similar to <CODE>asctime</CODE>, except that the
time value is specified as a <CODE>time_t</CODE> calendar time value rather
than in broken-down local time format.  It is equivalent to

</P>

<PRE>
asctime (localtime (<VAR>time</VAR>))
</PRE>

<P>
<CODE>ctime</CODE> sets the variable <CODE>tzname</CODE>, because <CODE>localtime</CODE>
does so.  See section <A HREF="libc_405.html#SEC412">Functions and Variables for Time Zones</A>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> char * <B>ctime_r</B> <I>(const time_t *<VAR>time</VAR>, char *<VAR>buffer</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2331"></A>
This function is similar to <CODE>ctime</CODE>, only that it places the result
in the string pointed to by <VAR>buffer</VAR>.  It is equivalent to (written
using gcc extensions, see section `Statement Exprs' in <CITE>Porting and Using gcc</CITE>):

</P>

<PRE>
({ struct tm tm; asctime_r (localtime_r (time, &#38;tm), buf); })
</PRE>

<P>
If no error occurred the function returns a pointer to the string the
result was written into, i.e., it returns <VAR>buffer</VAR>.  Otherwise
return <CODE>NULL</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> size_t <B>strftime</B> <I>(char *<VAR>s</VAR>, size_t <VAR>size</VAR>, const char *<VAR>template</VAR>, const struct tm *<VAR>brokentime</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2332"></A>
This function is similar to the <CODE>sprintf</CODE> function (see section <A HREF="libc_185.html#SEC192">Formatted Input</A>), but the conversion specifications that can appear in the format
template <VAR>template</VAR> are specialized for printing components of the date
and time <VAR>brokentime</VAR> according to the locale currently specified for
time conversion (see section <A HREF="libc_94.html#SEC98">Locales and Internationalization</A>).

</P>
<P>
Ordinary characters appearing in the <VAR>template</VAR> are copied to the
output string <VAR>s</VAR>; this can include multibyte character sequences.
Conversion specifiers are introduced by a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> character, followed
by an optional flag which can be one of the following.  These flags
are all GNU extensions. The first three affect only the output of
numbers:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>_</CODE>
<DD>
The number is padded with spaces.

<DT><CODE>-</CODE>
<DD>
The number is not padded at all.

<DT><CODE>0</CODE>
<DD>
The number is padded with zeros even if the format specifies padding
with spaces.

<DT><CODE>^</CODE>
<DD>
The output uses uppercase characters, but only if this is possible
(see section <A HREF="libc_59.html#SEC59">Case Conversion</A>).
</DL>

<P>
The default action is to pad the number with zeros to keep it a constant
width.  Numbers that do not have a range indicated below are never
padded, since there is no natural width for them.

</P>
<P>
Following the flag an optional specification of the width is possible.
This is specified in decimal notation.  If the natural size of the
output is of the field has less than the specified number of characters,
the result is written right adjusted and space padded to the given
size.

</P>
<P>
An optional modifier can follow the optional flag and width
specification.  The modifiers, which are POSIX.2 extensions, are:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>E</CODE>
<DD>
Use the locale's alternate representation for date and time.  This
modifier applies to the <CODE>%c</CODE>, <CODE>%C</CODE>, <CODE>%x</CODE>, <CODE>%X</CODE>,
<CODE>%y</CODE> and <CODE>%Y</CODE> format specifiers.  In a Japanese locale, for
example, <CODE>%Ex</CODE> might yield a date format based on the Japanese
Emperors' reigns.

<DT><CODE>O</CODE>
<DD>
Use the locale's alternate numeric symbols for numbers.  This modifier
applies only to numeric format specifiers.
</DL>

<P>
If the format supports the modifier but no alternate representation
is available, it is ignored.

</P>
<P>
The conversion specifier ends with a format specifier taken from the
following list.  The whole <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> sequence is replaced in the output
string as follows:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>%a</CODE>
<DD>
The abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale.

<DT><CODE>%A</CODE>
<DD>
The full weekday name according to the current locale.

(range <CODE>00</CODE> through <CODE>99</CODE>).  This has the same format and value
as <CODE>%y</CODE>, except that if the ISO week number (see <CODE>%V</CODE>) belongs
to the previous or next year, that year is used instead.

This format is a GNU extension.

<DT><CODE>%G</CODE>
<DD>
The year corresponding to the ISO week number.  This has the same format
and value as <CODE>%Y</CODE>, except that if the ISO week number (see
<CODE>%V</CODE>) belongs to the previous or next year, that year is used
instead.

This format is a GNU extension.

<DT><CODE>%s</CODE>
<DD>
The number of seconds since the epoch, i.e., since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

<DT><CODE>%V</CODE>
<DD>
The ISO 8601:1988 week number as a decimal number (range <CODE>01</CODE>
through <CODE>53</CODE>).  ISO weeks start with Monday and end with Sunday.
Week <CODE>01</CODE> of a year is the first week which has the majority of its
days in that year; this is equivalent to the week containing the year's
first Thursday, and it is also equivalent to the week containing January
4.  Week <CODE>01</CODE> of a year can contain days from the previous year.
The week before week <CODE>01</CODE> of a year is the last week (<CODE>52</CODE> or
<CODE>53</CODE>) of the previous year even if it contains days from the new
year.

This format is a POSIX.2 extension.

<DT><CODE>%w</CODE>

<DD>
The week number of the current year as a decimal number (range <CODE>00</CODE>
through <CODE>53</CODE>), starting with the first Monday as the first day of
the first week.  All days preceding the first Monday in the year are

time.

<DT><CODE>%X</CODE>
<DD>
The preferred time representation for the current locale, but with no date.

<DT><CODE>%y</CODE>
<DD>

<CODE>99</CODE>).  This is equivalent to the year modulo 100.

<DT><CODE>%Y</CODE>
<DD>
The year as a decimal number, using the Gregorian calendar.  Years
before the year <CODE>1</CODE> are numbered <CODE>0</CODE>, <CODE>-1</CODE>, and so on.

<DT><CODE>%z</CODE>
<DD>
RFC 822/ISO 8601:1988 style numeric time zone (e.g.,
<CODE>-0600</CODE> or <CODE>+0100</CODE>), or nothing if no time zone is
determinable.

This format is a GNU extension.

A full RFC 822 timestamp is generated by the format
<SAMP>`"%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z"'</SAMP> (or the equivalent
<SAMP>`"%a, %d %b %Y %T %z"'</SAMP>).

<DT><CODE>%Z</CODE>
<DD>
The time zone abbreviation (empty if the time zone can't be determined).

<DT><CODE>%%</CODE>
<DD>

</DL>

<P>
The <VAR>size</VAR> parameter can be used to specify the maximum number of
characters to be stored in the array <VAR>s</VAR>, including the terminating
null character.  If the formatted time requires more than <VAR>size</VAR>
characters, <CODE>strftime</CODE> returns zero and the content of the array
<VAR>s</VAR> is indetermined.  Otherwise the return value indicates the
number of characters placed in the array <VAR>s</VAR>, not including the
terminating null character.

</P>
<P>
<EM>Warning:</EM> This convention for the return value which is prescribed
in ISO C can lead to problems in some situations.  For certain
format strings and certain locales the output really can be the empty
string and this cannot be discovered by testing the return value only.
E.g., in most locales the AM/PM time format is not supported (most of
the world uses the 24 hour time representation).  In such locales
<CODE>"%p"</CODE> will return the empty string, i.e., the return value is
zero.  To detect situations like this something similar to the following
code should be used:

</P>

<PRE>
buf[0] = '\1';
len = strftime (buf, bufsize, format, tp);
if (len == 0 &#38;&#38; buf[0] != '\0')
  {
    /* Something went wrong in the strftime call.  */
    ...
  }
</PRE>

<P>
If <VAR>s</VAR> is a null pointer, <CODE>strftime</CODE> does not actually write
anything, but instead returns the number of characters it would have written.

</P>
<P>
According to POSIX.1 every call to <CODE>strftime</CODE> implies a call to
<CODE>tzset</CODE>.  So the contents of the environment variable <CODE>TZ</CODE>
is examined before any output is produced.

</P>
<P>
For an example of <CODE>strftime</CODE>, see section <A HREF="libc_406.html#SEC413">Time Functions Example</A>.
