<H3><A NAME="SEC147" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC147">The Stages of Word Expansion</A></H3>

<P>
When word expansion is applied to a sequence of words, it performs the
following transformations in the order shown here:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX737"></A>
<STRONG>Tilde expansion</STRONG>: Replacement of <SAMP>`~foo'</SAMP> with the name of
the home directory of <SAMP>`foo'</SAMP>.

<LI>

Next, three different transformations are applied in the same step,
from left to right:


<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX738"></A>
<A NAME="IDX739"></A>
<STRONG>Variable substitution</STRONG>: Environment variables are substituted for
references such as <SAMP>`$foo'</SAMP>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX740"></A>
<STRONG>Command substitution</STRONG>: Constructs such as <SAMP>``cat foo`'</SAMP> and
the equivalent <SAMP>`$(cat foo)'</SAMP> are replaced with the output from
the inner command.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX741"></A>
<STRONG>Arithmetic expansion</STRONG>: Constructs such as <SAMP>`$(($x-1))'</SAMP> are
replaced with the result of the arithmetic computation.
</UL>

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX742"></A>
<STRONG>Field splitting</STRONG>: subdivision of the text into <STRONG>words</STRONG>.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX743"></A>
<STRONG>Wildcard expansion</STRONG>: The replacement of a construct such as <SAMP>`*.c'</SAMP>
with a list of <SAMP>`.c'</SAMP> file names.  Wildcard expansion applies to an
entire word at a time, and replaces that word with 0 or more file names
that are themselves words.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX744"></A>
<A NAME="IDX745"></A>
<STRONG>Quote removal</STRONG>: The deletion of string-quotes, now that they have
done their job by inhibiting the above transformations when appropriate.
</OL>

<P>
For the details of these transformations, and how to write the constructs
that use them, see <CITE>The BASH Manual</CITE> (to appear).
