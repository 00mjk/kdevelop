<H3><A NAME="SEC152" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC152">Details of Variable Substitution</A></H3>

<P>
Part of ordinary shell syntax is the use of <SAMP>`$<VAR>variable</VAR>'</SAMP> to
substitute the value of a shell variable into a command.  This is called
<STRONG>variable substitution</STRONG>, and it is one part of doing word expansion.

</P>
<P>
There are two basic ways you can write a variable reference for
substitution:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
If you write braces around the variable name, then it is completely
unambiguous where the variable name ends.  You can concatenate
additional letters onto the end of the variable value by writing them
immediately after the close brace.  For example, <SAMP>`${foo}s'</SAMP>
expands into <SAMP>`tractors'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>$<VAR>variable</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
If you do not put braces around the variable name, then the variable
name consists of all the alphanumeric characters and underscores that
follow the <SAMP>`$'</SAMP>.  The next punctuation character ends the variable
name.  Thus, <SAMP>`$foo-bar'</SAMP> refers to the variable <CODE>foo</CODE> and expands
into <SAMP>`tractor-bar'</SAMP>.
</DL>

<P>
When you use braces, you can also use various constructs to modify the
value that is substituted, or test it in various ways.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>:-<VAR>default</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but if that is empty or
undefined, use <VAR>default</VAR> instead.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>:=<VAR>default</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but if that is empty or
undefined, use <VAR>default</VAR> instead and set the variable to
<VAR>default</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>:?<VAR>message</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>variable</VAR> is defined and not empty, substitute its value.

Otherwise, print <VAR>message</VAR> as an error message on the standard error
stream, and consider word expansion a failure.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>:+<VAR>replacement</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute <VAR>replacement</VAR>, but only if <VAR>variable</VAR> is defined and
nonempty.  Otherwise, substitute nothing for this construct.
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>${#<VAR>variable</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute a numeral which expresses in base ten the number of
characters in the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>.  <SAMP>`${#foo}'</SAMP> stands for
<SAMP>`7'</SAMP>, because <SAMP>`tractor'</SAMP> is seven characters.
</DL>

<P>
These variants of variable substitution let you remove part of the
variable's value before substituting it.  The <VAR>prefix</VAR> and
<VAR>suffix</VAR> are not mere strings; they are wildcard patterns, just
like the patterns that you use to match multiple file names.  But
in this context, they match against parts of the variable value
rather than against file names.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>%%<VAR>suffix</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but first discard from that
variable any portion at the end that matches the pattern <VAR>suffix</VAR>.

If there is more than one alternative for how to match against
<VAR>suffix</VAR>, this construct uses the longest possible match.

Thus, <SAMP>`${foo%%r*}'</SAMP> substitutes <SAMP>`t'</SAMP>, because the largest
match for <SAMP>`r*'</SAMP> at the end of <SAMP>`tractor'</SAMP> is <SAMP>`ractor'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>%<VAR>suffix</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but first discard from that
variable any portion at the end that matches the pattern <VAR>suffix</VAR>.

If there is more than one alternative for how to match against
<VAR>suffix</VAR>, this construct uses the shortest possible alternative.

Thus, <SAMP>`${foo%%r*}'</SAMP> substitutes <SAMP>`tracto'</SAMP>, because the shortest
match for <SAMP>`r*'</SAMP> at the end of <SAMP>`tractor'</SAMP> is just <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>##<VAR>prefix</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but first discard from that
variable any portion at the beginning that matches the pattern <VAR>prefix</VAR>.

If there is more than one alternative for how to match against
<VAR>prefix</VAR>, this construct uses the longest possible match.

Thus, <SAMP>`${foo%%r*}'</SAMP> substitutes <SAMP>`t'</SAMP>, because the largest
match for <SAMP>`r*'</SAMP> at the end of <SAMP>`tractor'</SAMP> is <SAMP>`ractor'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>${<VAR>variable</VAR>#<VAR>prefix</VAR>}</CODE>
<DD>
Substitute the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, but first discard from that
variable any portion at the beginning that matches the pattern <VAR>prefix</VAR>.

If there is more than one alternative for how to match against
<VAR>prefix</VAR>, this construct uses the shortest possible alternative.

Thus, <SAMP>`${foo%%r*}'</SAMP> substitutes <SAMP>`tracto'</SAMP>, because the shortest
match for <SAMP>`r*'</SAMP> at the end of <SAMP>`tractor'</SAMP> is just <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>.
