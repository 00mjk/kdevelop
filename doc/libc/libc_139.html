<STRONG>Word expansion</STRONG> means the process of splitting a string into
<STRONG>words</STRONG> and substituting for variables, commands, and wildcards
just as the shell does.

</P>
<P>
For example, when you write <SAMP>`ls -l foo.c'</SAMP>, this string is split
into three separate words---<SAMP>`ls'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`foo.c'</SAMP>.
This is the most basic function of word expansion.

</P>
<P>
When you write <SAMP>`ls *.c'</SAMP>, this can become many words, because
the word <SAMP>`*.c'</SAMP> can be replaced with any number of file names.
This is called <STRONG>wildcard expansion</STRONG>, and it is also a part of
word expansion.

</P>
<P>
When you use <SAMP>`echo $PATH'</SAMP> to print your path, you are taking
advantage of <STRONG>variable substitution</STRONG>, which is also part of word
expansion.

</P>
<P>
Ordinary programs can perform word expansion just like the shell by
calling the library function <CODE>wordexp</CODE>.
