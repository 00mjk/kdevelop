<H3><A NAME="SEC471" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC471">Using <CODE>pause</CODE></A></H3>

<P>
The simple way to wait until a signal arrives is to call <CODE>pause</CODE>.
Please read about its disadvantages, in the following section, before
you use it.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>pause</B> <I>()</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2594"></A>
The <CODE>pause</CODE> function suspends program execution until a signal
arrives whose action is either to execute a handler function, or to
terminate the process.

</P>
<P>
If the signal causes a handler function to be executed, then
<CODE>pause</CODE> returns.  This is considered an unsuccessful return (since
"successful" behavior would be to suspend the program forever), so the
return value is <CODE>-1</CODE>.  Even if you specify that other primitives
should resume when a system handler returns (see section <A HREF="libc_449.html#SEC456">Primitives Interrupted by Signals</A>), this has no effect on <CODE>pause</CODE>; it always fails when a
signal is handled.

</P>
<P>
The following <CODE>errno</CODE> error conditions are defined for this function:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>EINTR</CODE>
<DD>
The function was interrupted by delivery of a signal.
</DL>

<P>
If the signal causes program termination, <CODE>pause</CODE> doesn't return
(obviously).

</P>
<P>
This function is a cancelation point in multi-threaded programs.  This
is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like memory, file
descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time <CODE>pause</CODE> is
called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay allocated
until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to <CODE>pause</CODE> should be
protected using cancelation handlers.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>pause</CODE> function is declared in  <TT>`unistd.h'</TT>.
</DL>
