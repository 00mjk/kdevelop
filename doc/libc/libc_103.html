<H4><A NAME="SEC107" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC107">Printing the Currency Symbol</A></H4>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX602"></A>

</P>
<P>
These members of the <CODE>struct lconv</CODE> structure specify how to print
the symbol to identify a monetary value--the international analog of
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> for US dollars.

</P>
<P>
Each country has two standard currency symbols.  The <STRONG>local currency
symbol</STRONG> is used commonly within the country, while the
<STRONG>international currency symbol</STRONG> is used internationally to refer to
that country's currency when it is necessary to indicate the country
unambiguously.

</P>
<P>
For example, many countries use the dollar as their monetary unit, and
when dealing with international currencies it's important to specify
that one is dealing with (say) Canadian dollars instead of U.S. dollars
or Australian dollars.  But when the context is known to be Canada,
there is no need to make this explicit--dollar amounts are implicitly
assumed to be in Canadian dollars.

<DT><CODE>char *currency_symbol</CODE>
<DD>
The local currency symbol for the selected locale.

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, this member has a value of <CODE>""</CODE>
(the empty string), meaning "unspecified".  The ISO standard doesn't
say what to do when you find this value; we recommend you simply print
the empty string as you would print any other string found in the
appropriate member.

<DT><CODE>char *int_curr_symbol</CODE>
<DD>
The international currency symbol for the selected locale.

The value of <CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE> should normally consist of a
three-letter abbreviation determined by the international standard
<CITE>ISO 4217 Codes for the Representation of Currency and Funds</CITE>,
followed by a one-character separator (often a space).

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, this member has a value of <CODE>""</CODE>
(the empty string), meaning "unspecified".  We recommend you simply
print the empty string as you would print any other string found in the
appropriate member.

<DT><CODE>char p_cs_precedes</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char n_cs_precedes</CODE>
<DD>
These members are <CODE>1</CODE> if the <CODE>currency_symbol</CODE> string should
precede the value of a monetary amount, or <CODE>0</CODE> if the string should
follow the value.  The <CODE>p_cs_precedes</CODE> member applies to positive
amounts (or zero), and the <CODE>n_cs_precedes</CODE> member applies to
negative amounts.

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both of these members have a value of
<CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>, meaning "unspecified".  The ISO standard doesn't say
what to do when you find this value, but we recommend printing the
currency symbol before the amount.  That's right for most countries.
In other words, treat all nonzero values alike in these members.

The POSIX standard says that these two members apply to the
<CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE> as well as the <CODE>currency_symbol</CODE>.  The ISO
C standard seems to imply that they should apply only to the
<CODE>currency_symbol</CODE>---so the <CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE> should always
precede the amount.

We can only guess which of these (if either) matches the usual
conventions for printing international currency symbols.  Our guess is
that they should always precede the amount.  If we find out a reliable
answer, we will put it here.

<DT><CODE>char p_sep_by_space</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char n_sep_by_space</CODE>
<DD>
These members are <CODE>1</CODE> if a space should appear between the
<CODE>currency_symbol</CODE> string and the amount, or <CODE>0</CODE> if no space
should appear.  The <CODE>p_sep_by_space</CODE> member applies to positive
amounts (or zero), and the <CODE>n_sep_by_space</CODE> member applies to
negative amounts.

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both of these members have a value of
<CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>, meaning "unspecified".  The ISO standard doesn't say
what you should do when you find this value; we suggest you treat it as
one (print a space).  In other words, treat all nonzero values alike in
these members.

These members apply only to <CODE>currency_symbol</CODE>.  When you use
<CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE>, you never print an additional space, because
<CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE> itself contains the appropriate separator.

The POSIX standard says that these two members apply to the
<CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE> as well as the <CODE>currency_symbol</CODE>.  But an
example in the ISO C standard clearly implies that they should apply
only to the <CODE>currency_symbol</CODE>---that the <CODE>int_curr_symbol</CODE>
contains any appropriate separator, so you should never print an
additional space.

Based on what we know now, we recommend you ignore these members when
printing international currency symbols, and print no extra space.
