<P>
These are the standard members of <CODE>struct lconv</CODE>; there may be
others.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>char *decimal_point</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char *mon_decimal_point</CODE>
<DD>
These are the decimal-point separators used in formatting non-monetary
and monetary quantities, respectively.  In the <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, the
value of <CODE>decimal_point</CODE> is <CODE>"."</CODE>, and the value of
<CODE>mon_decimal_point</CODE> is <CODE>""</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX600"></A>

<DT><CODE>char *thousands_sep</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char *mon_thousands_sep</CODE>
<DD>
These are the separators used to delimit groups of digits to the left of
the decimal point in formatting non-monetary and monetary quantities,
respectively.  In the <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both members have a value of
<CODE>""</CODE> (the empty string).

<DT><CODE>char *grouping</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char *mon_grouping</CODE>
<DD>
These are strings that specify how to group the digits to the left of
the decimal point.  <CODE>grouping</CODE> applies to non-monetary quantities
and <CODE>mon_grouping</CODE> applies to monetary quantities.  Use either
<CODE>thousands_sep</CODE> or <CODE>mon_thousands_sep</CODE> to separate the digit
groups.
<A NAME="IDX601"></A>

Each string is made up of decimal numbers separated by semicolons.
Successive numbers (from left to right) give the sizes of successive
groups (from right to left, starting at the decimal point).  The last
number in the string is used over and over for all the remaining groups.

If the last integer is <CODE>-1</CODE>, it means that there is no more
grouping--or, put another way, any remaining digits form one large
group without separators.

For example, if <CODE>grouping</CODE> is <CODE>"4;3;2"</CODE>, the correct grouping
for the number <CODE>123456787654321</CODE> is <SAMP>`12'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`34'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`56'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`78'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`765'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`4321'</SAMP>.  This uses a group of 4
digits at the end, preceded by a group of 3 digits, preceded by groups
of 2 digits (as many as needed).  With a separator of <SAMP>`,'</SAMP>, the
number would be printed as <SAMP>`12,34,56,78,765,4321'</SAMP>.

A value of <CODE>"3"</CODE> indicates repeated groups of three digits, as
normally used in the U.S.

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both <CODE>grouping</CODE> and
<CODE>mon_grouping</CODE> have a value of <CODE>""</CODE>.  This value specifies no
grouping at all.

<DT><CODE>char int_frac_digits</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>char frac_digits</CODE>
<DD>
These are small integers indicating how many fractional digits (to the
right of the decimal point) should be displayed in a monetary value in
international and local formats, respectively.  (Most often, both
members have the same value.)

In the standard <SAMP>`C'</SAMP> locale, both of these members have the value
<CODE>CHAR_MAX</CODE>, meaning "unspecified".  The ISO standard doesn't say
what to do when you find this the value; we recommend printing no
fractional digits.  (This locale also specifies the empty string for
<CODE>mon_decimal_point</CODE>, so printing any fractional digits would be
confusing!)
