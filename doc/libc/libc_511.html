<P>
The <CODE>_exit</CODE> function is the primitive used for process termination
by <CODE>exit</CODE>.  It is declared in the header file <TT>`unistd.h'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX2748"></A>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> void <B>_exit</B> <I>(int <VAR>status</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2749"></A>
The <CODE>_exit</CODE> function is the primitive for causing a process to
terminate with status <VAR>status</VAR>.  Calling this function does not
execute cleanup functions registered with <CODE>atexit</CODE> or
<CODE>on_exit</CODE>.

<DT><U>Function:</U> void <B>_Exit</B> <I>(int <VAR>status</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX2750"></A>
The <CODE>_Exit</CODE> function is the ISO C equivalent to <CODE>_exit</CODE>.
The ISO C committee members were not sure whether the definitions of
<CODE>_exit</CODE> and <CODE>_Exit</CODE> were compatible so they have not used the
POSIX name.

</P>
<P>
This function was introduced in ISO C9x and is declared in
<TT>`stdlib.h'</TT>.

<P>
When a process terminates for any reason--either by an explicit
termination call, or termination as a result of a signal--the
following things happen:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

All open file descriptors in the process are closed.  See section <A HREF="libc_213.html#SEC220">Low-Level Input/Output</A>.
Note that streams are not flushed automatically when the process
terminates; see section <A HREF="libc_155.html#SEC162">Input/Output on Streams</A>.

<LI>

The low-order 8 bits of the return status code are saved to be reported
back to the parent process via <CODE>wait</CODE> or <CODE>waitpid</CODE>; see
section <A HREF="libc_518.html#SEC526">Process Completion</A>.

<LI>

Any child processes of the process being terminated are assigned a new
parent process.  (On most systems, including GNU, this is the <CODE>init</CODE>
process, with process ID 1.)

<LI>

A <CODE>SIGCHLD</CODE> signal is sent to the parent process.

<LI>

If the process is a session leader that has a controlling terminal, then
a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE> signal is sent to each process in the foreground job,
and the controlling terminal is disassociated from that session.
See section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>.

<LI>

If termination of a process causes a process group to become orphaned,
and any member of that process group is stopped, then a <CODE>SIGHUP</CODE>
signal and a <CODE>SIGCONT</CODE> signal are sent to each process in the
group.  See section <A HREF="libc_522.html#SEC530">Job Control</A>.
