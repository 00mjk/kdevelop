<H2><A NAME="SEC85" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC85">Non-reentrant Conversion Function</A></H2>

<P>
The functions described in the last chapter are defined in the second
amendment to ISO C89.  But the original ISO C89 standard also
contained functions for character set conversion.  The reason that they
are not described in the first place is that they are almost entirely
useless.

</P>
<P>
The problem is that all the functions for conversion defined in ISO
C89 use a local state.  This implies that multiple conversions at the
same time (not only when using threads) cannot be done, and that you
cannot first convert single characters and then strings since you cannot
tell the conversion functions which state to use.

</P>
<P>
These functions are therefore usable only in a very limited set of
situations.  One must complete converting the entire string before
starting a new one and each string/text must be converted with the same
function (there is no problem with the library itself; it is guaranteed
that no library function changes the state of any of these functions).
<STRONG>For the above reasons it is highly requested that the functions
from the last section are used in place of non-reentrant conversion
functions.</STRONG>
