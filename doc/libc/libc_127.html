<H2><A NAME="SEC134" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC134">Wildcard Matching</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX722"></A>
This section describes how to match a wildcard pattern against a
particular string.  The result is a yes or no answer: does the
string fit the pattern or not.  The symbols described here are all
declared in <TT>`fnmatch.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>fnmatch</B> <I>(const char *<VAR>pattern</VAR>, const char *<VAR>string</VAR>, int <VAR>flags</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX723"></A>
This function tests whether the string <VAR>string</VAR> matches the pattern
<VAR>pattern</VAR>.  It returns <CODE>0</CODE> if they do match; otherwise, it
returns the nonzero value <CODE>FNM_NOMATCH</CODE>.  The arguments
<VAR>pattern</VAR> and <VAR>string</VAR> are both strings.

</P>
<P>
The argument <VAR>flags</VAR> is a combination of flag bits that alter the
details of matching.  See below for a list of the defined flags.

</P>
<P>
In the GNU C Library, <CODE>fnmatch</CODE> cannot experience an "error"---it
always returns an answer for whether the match succeeds.  However, other
implementations of <CODE>fnmatch</CODE> might sometimes report "errors".
They would do so by returning nonzero values that are not equal to
<CODE>FNM_NOMATCH</CODE>.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
These are the available flags for the <VAR>flags</VAR> argument:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FNM_FILE_NAME</CODE>
<DD>
Treat the <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> character specially, for matching file names.  If
this flag is set, wildcard constructs in <VAR>pattern</VAR> cannot match
<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> in <VAR>string</VAR>.  Thus, the only way to match <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> is with
an explicit <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> in <VAR>pattern</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>FNM_PATHNAME</CODE>
<DD>
This is an alias for <CODE>FNM_FILE_NAME</CODE>; it comes from POSIX.2.  We
don't recommend this name because we don't use the term "pathname" for
file names.

<DT><CODE>FNM_PERIOD</CODE>
<DD>
Treat the <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> character specially if it appears at the beginning of
<VAR>string</VAR>.  If this flag is set, wildcard constructs in <VAR>pattern</VAR>
cannot match <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> as the first character of <VAR>string</VAR>.

If you set both <CODE>FNM_PERIOD</CODE> and <CODE>FNM_FILE_NAME</CODE>, then the
special treatment applies to <SAMP>`.'</SAMP> following <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> as well as to
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> at the beginning of <VAR>string</VAR>.  (The shell uses the
<CODE>FNM_PERIOD</CODE> and <CODE>FNM_FILE_NAME</CODE> flags together for matching
file names.)

<DT><CODE>FNM_NOESCAPE</CODE>
<DD>
Don't treat the <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> character specially in patterns.  Normally,
<SAMP>`\'</SAMP> quotes the following character, turning off its special meaning
(if any) so that it matches only itself.  When quoting is enabled, the
pattern <SAMP>`\?'</SAMP> matches only the string <SAMP>`?'</SAMP>, because the question
mark in the pattern acts like an ordinary character.

If you use <CODE>FNM_NOESCAPE</CODE>, then <SAMP>`\'</SAMP> is an ordinary character.

<DT><CODE>FNM_LEADING_DIR</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore a trailing sequence of characters starting with a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> in
<VAR>string</VAR>; that is to say, test whether <VAR>string</VAR> starts with a
directory name that <VAR>pattern</VAR> matches.

If this flag is set, either <SAMP>`foo*'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`foobar'</SAMP> as a pattern
would match the string <SAMP>`foobar/frobozz'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>FNM_CASEFOLD</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore case in comparing <VAR>string</VAR> to <VAR>pattern</VAR>.
