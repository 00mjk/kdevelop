<H1><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC57">Character Handling</A></H1>

<P>
Programs that work with characters and strings often need to classify a
character--is it alphabetic, is it a digit, is it whitespace, and so
on--and perform case conversion operations on characters.  The
functions in the header file <TT>`ctype.h'</TT> are provided for this
purpose.
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>

</P>
<P>
Since the choice of locale and character set can alter the
classifications of particular character codes, all of these functions
are affected by the current locale.  (More precisely, they are affected
by the locale currently selected for character classification--the
<CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> category; see section <A HREF="libc_97.html#SEC101">Categories of Activities that Locales Affect</A>.)

</P>
<P>
The ISO C standard specifies two different sets of functions.  The
one set works on <CODE>char</CODE> type characters, the other one on
<CODE>wchar_t</CODE> wide character (see section <A HREF="libc_77.html#SEC77">Introduction to Extended Characters</A>).
