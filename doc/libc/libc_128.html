The archetypal use of wildcards is for matching against the files in a
directory, and making a list of all the matches.  This is called
<STRONG>globbing</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
You could do this using <CODE>fnmatch</CODE>, by reading the directory entries
one by one and testing each one with <CODE>fnmatch</CODE>.  But that would be
slow (and complex, since you would have to handle subdirectories by
hand).

</P>
<P>
The library provides a function <CODE>glob</CODE> to make this particular use
of wildcards convenient.  <CODE>glob</CODE> and the other symbols in this
section are declared in <TT>`glob.h'</TT>.
