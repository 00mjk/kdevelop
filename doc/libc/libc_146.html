<H1><A NAME="SEC153" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC153">Input/Output Overview</A></H1>

<P>
Most programs need to do either input (reading data) or output (writing
data), or most frequently both, in order to do anything useful.  The GNU
C library provides such a large selection of input and output functions
that the hardest part is often deciding which function is most
appropriate!

</P>
<P>
This chapter introduces concepts and terminology relating to input
and output.  Other chapters relating to the GNU I/O facilities are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_155.html#SEC162">Input/Output on Streams</A>, which covers the high-level functions
that operate on streams, including formatted input and output.

<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_213.html#SEC220">Low-Level Input/Output</A>, which covers the basic I/O and control
functions on file descriptors.

<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_244.html#SEC251">File System Interface</A>, which covers functions for operating on
directories and for manipulating file attributes such as access modes
and ownership.

<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_273.html#SEC280">Pipes and FIFOs</A>, which includes information on the basic interprocess
communication facilities.

<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_278.html#SEC285">Sockets</A>, which covers a more complicated interprocess communication
facility with support for networking.

<LI>

section <A HREF="libc_331.html#SEC338">Low-Level Terminal Interface</A>, which covers functions for changing
how input and output to terminal or other serial devices are processed.
