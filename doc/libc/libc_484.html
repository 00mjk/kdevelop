<H4><A NAME="SEC492" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC492">Flags for Argp Options</A></H4>

<P>
The following flags may be or'd together in the <CODE>flags</CODE> field of a
<CODE>struct argp_option</CODE>, and control various aspects of how that
option is parsed or displayed in help messages:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>OPTION_ARG_OPTIONAL</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2652"></A>
The argument associated with this option is optional.

<DT><CODE>OPTION_HIDDEN</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2653"></A>
This option isn't displayed in any help messages.

<DT><CODE>OPTION_ALIAS</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2654"></A>
This option is an alias for the closest previous non-alias option.  This
means that it will be displayed in the same help entry, and will inherit
fields other than <CODE>name</CODE> and <CODE>key</CODE> from the aliased option.

<DT><CODE>OPTION_DOC</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2655"></A>
This option isn't actually an option (and so should be ignored by the
actual option parser), but rather an arbitrary piece of documentation
that should be displayed in much the same manner as the options (known
as a <STRONG>documentation option</STRONG>).

If this flag is set, then the option <CODE>name</CODE> field is displayed
unmodified (e.g., no <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> prefix is added) at the left-margin
(where a <EM>short</EM> option would normally be displayed), and the
documentation string in the normal place.  For purposes of sorting, any
leading whitespace and punctuation is ignored, except that if the first
non-whitespace character is not <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>, this entry is displayed after
all options (and <CODE>OPTION_DOC</CODE> entries with a leading <SAMP>`-'</SAMP>) in
the same group.

<DT><CODE>OPTION_NO_USAGE</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2656"></A>
This option shouldn't be included in `long' usage messages (but is still
included in help messages).  This is mainly intended for options that
are completely documented in an argp's <CODE>args_doc</CODE> field
(see section <A HREF="libc_482.html#SEC490">Specifying Argp Parsers</A>), in which case including the option
in the generic usage list would be redundant.

For instance, if <CODE>args_doc</CODE> is <CODE>"FOO BAR\n-x BLAH"</CODE>, and the
<SAMP>`-x'</SAMP> option's purpose is to distinguish these two cases, <SAMP>`-x'</SAMP>
should probably be marked <CODE>OPTION_NO_USAGE</CODE>.
