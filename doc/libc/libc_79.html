<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC79">Restartable Multibyte Conversion Functions</A></H2>

<P>
The ISO C standard defines functions to convert strings from a
multibyte representation to wide character strings.  There are a number
of peculiarities:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The character set assumed for the multibyte encoding is not specified
as an argument to the functions.  Instead the character set specified by
the <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> category of the current locale is used; see
section <A HREF="libc_97.html#SEC101">Categories of Activities that Locales Affect</A>.

<LI>

The functions handling more than one character at a time require NUL
terminated strings as the argument.  I.e., converting blocks of text
does not work unless one can add a NUL byte at an appropriate place.
The GNU C library contains some extensions the standard which allow
specifying a size but basically they also expect terminated strings.
</UL>

<P>
Despite these limitations the ISO C functions can very well be used
in many contexts.  In graphical user interfaces, for instance, it is not
uncommon to have functions which require text to be displayed in a wide
character string if it is not simple ASCII.  The text itself might come
from a file with translations and the user should decide about the
current locale which determines the translation and therefore also the
external encoding used.  In such a situation (and many others) the
functions described here are perfect.  If more freedom while performing
the conversion is necessary take a look at the <CODE>iconv</CODE> functions
(see section <A HREF="libc_89.html#SEC89">Generic Charset Conversion</A>).
