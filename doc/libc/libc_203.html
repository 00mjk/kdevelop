<H2><A NAME="SEC210" HREF="libc_toc.html#TOC210">Other Kinds of Streams</A></H2>

<P>
The GNU library provides ways for you to define additional kinds of
streams that do not necessarily correspond to an open file.

</P>
<P>
One such type of stream takes input from or writes output to a string.
These kinds of streams are used internally to implement the
<CODE>sprintf</CODE> and <CODE>sscanf</CODE> functions.  You can also create such a
stream explicitly, using the functions described in section <A HREF="libc_204.html#SEC211">String Streams</A>.

</P>
<P>
More generally, you can define streams that do input/output to arbitrary
objects using functions supplied by your program.  This protocol is
discussed in section <A HREF="libc_206.html#SEC213">Programming Your Own Custom Streams</A>.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Portability Note:</STRONG> The facilities described in this section are
specific to GNU.  Other systems or C implementations might or might not
provide equivalent functionality.
